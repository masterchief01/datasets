      </h1>
                    
      <p><strong>1. Neglecting Your Partner</strong> (ignoring, workaholism, <a href="addiction-issues.php">addictions</a>):<br>
        A primary function of a relationship is to provide companionship and to 
        meet each other&#8217;s needs. When other activities, interests or preoccupations 
        interfere with our availability, we can wind up short-changing our partner. 
        This can be thought of as absenteeism or being MIA. Taking an inventory 
        and making adjustments in how we spend our time is the first step in correcting 
        this problem. Treat your partner as the important person they are by spending 
        enough quality time together to satisfy each of your requirements in this 
        area and to maintain your connection.</p>
                    
      <p><strong>2. Depriving Your Partner </strong>(not being attentive, expressive, 
        affectionate, supportive, caring, loving):<br>
        Being there physically is not enough. We cannot expect our relationship 
        to thrive if we withdraw emotionally for extended periods of time. In 
        order to be fully present, we must be aware of our partner and be willing 
        to show how we feel both verbally and non-verbally. Expressing love though 
        affection and caring behaviors are crucial to keeping a relationship strong 
        and vibrant. Small regular doses of intimacy will usually suffice, and 
        the most important times of day to communicate positively are upon waking, 
        upon reuniting after a long day, and before going to sleep.</p>
                    
      <p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Dishonesty &amp; Betrayal </strong>(infidelity, 
        lying):<br>
        Most people are aware that the foundation of any relationship is T-R-U-S-T. 
        In no relationship is trust more important than in a relationship between 
        mates, except for a parent and dependent child relationship. Cheating 
        and lying breaks down the basis for a relationship, and often results 
        in its demise. A problem of this nature is serious, and resolving it must 
        be a top priority if the relationship is to survive. <a href="therapy/couples/">Couples 
        counseling</a> is highly recommended in order to facilitate the changes 
        that are needed.</p>
      <p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Attacking Your Partner </strong>(blaming, 
        abuse &#8211; physical, emotional, sexual):<br>
        Aggressive communication is simply unacceptable, especially if the abuse 
        is getting physical. Physical or sexual abuse are deal-breakers in a marriage, 
        and should prompt a permanent separation. The abusive partner needs to 
        get professional help to learn skills in <a href="anger-management.php">anger 
        management</a>, in order to gain and consistently demonstrate better control 
        over his or her emotions and behavior. Even if the help is sought and 
        progress is made, the risk of recurrence remains high, so in most cases, 
        the abused partner should not return to the relationship. Returning serves 
        to reinforce the abusive behavior, leading to increased severity and frequency 
        of subsequent abuse. Instead, the abused partner should also seek help, 
        and work through issues that have potential to lead one into another abusive 
        relationship. Verbally blaming, accusing, and insulting your partner are 
        less extreme forms of destructiveness, but are not OK either, and <a href="assertiveness-training.php">assertiveness 
        training</a> can provide the essential skills for healthy communication.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Scapegoating </strong>(taking your anger or frustration out 
        on you partner):<br>
        We all know that it&#8217;s not right to kick the dog after a hard day 
        at work, so why do it to your partner? Being held responsible for things 
        that are out of our control is the most stressful of conditions, and that 
        is what we do to our partner when we scapegoat them. Rather than hurt 
        the ones you love, do what it takes to meet the real problem head-on, 
        as effectively as you can. If you are unsure of how to address a problem, 
        the strong and mature thing to do is to ask for help and support from 
        trusted sources (i.e., a friend, relative, or therapist). </p>
                    
      <p><strong>6. Negativism</strong> (nitpicking, nagging, criticizing):<br>
        In order to have a good relationship, the positives must outweigh the 
        negatives by a large percentage. If negativity is creeping into your relationship, 
        it is like water seeping into walls, eventually weakening the structure. 
        People usually feel good around others who are upbeat and positive, as 
        well as those who help them to feel good about themselves. Bringing a 
        negative spirit into your relationship crowds out the positive. However, 
        pushing aside or neglecting to address real problems is not the answer 
        either, and can be just as harmful to relationship health as dwelling 
        on the negative. So pick your battles wisely, strive to communicate effectively, 
        and practice cooperative negotiation.</p> 
      <p><strong>7. Gossiping </strong>(telling family or friends about your problems 
        but not addressing them with your partner):<br>
        That&#8217;s right, if you are talking about the problems in your relationship 
        with friends or relatives but not working on improving the situation, 
        that amounts to gossip. Gossip is not a productive way to handle problems, 
        and can result in additional problems. For instance, your partner may 
        feel betrayed that you revealed sensitive material to others that cause 
        him or her to be embarrassed or uncomfortable around them. Also, if you 
        promote a negative side of your partner or your relationship, others may 
        get a distorted view, and changes in their attitudes and behavior may 
        follow. Others may remember your conflicts long after you and your partner 
        have gotten past them. Instead, work on improving your communication skills. 
        Turn toward your partner, not away. If you need help, seek out the assistance 
        of an objective third party such as a therapist who works with couples. 
        When it comes to your needs, stop complaining and start asking!</p>
                    
      <p><strong>8. Controlling Your Partner </strong>(&#8220;my way&#8221; or 
        else, perfectionism, trying to change your partner, possessiveness):<br>
        Wanting things to be a certain way and having preferences are completely 
        natural and even healthy. However, when this tendency becomes extreme 
        and starts to encroach on the rights, needs and desires of others, it 
        can cause major havoc. Freedom of will and self-determination are basic 
        needs, and when these are being threatened, negative reactions may include 
        anger, resentment, and/or rebellion. If the need to control is a problem 
        in your relationship, identify the motivations behind it and work towards 
        dealing with those issues rather than acting them out with your partner.</p>
                    
      <p><strong>9. Putting Yourself First </strong>(self-centeredness, selfishness, 
        entitlement):<br>
        It&#8217;s not &#8220;all about me,&#8221; folks. Letting one&#8217;s 
        self interests take priority in an unbalanced way can be toxic to a partnership. 
        The other person usually winds up feeling deprived, resentful, and unimportant. 
        Furthermore, the more self-involved you are, the more you take your relationship 
        for granted, the less you appreciate your partner, and the more alone 
        you actually are. So if your relationship is slanted in this way, you 
        also lose out, because you experience less of the joy that a true connection 
        brings. You and you partner both get more from the relationship through 
        reciprocity in giving and receiving.</p>
                    
      <p><strong>10. Putting Yourself Last </strong>(self-neglect, passivity, 
        self sacrifice):<br>
        Martyrs are seldom happy. More often, they are angry, bitter, resentful, 
        depressed and burned out. This is not to say that you should not consider 
        others and be thoughtful in meeting their needs. But having a healthy 
        relationship involves factoring your own needs and desires into the equation. 
        You teach people how to treat you, and if you act like a doormat, you 
        can&#8217;t completely blame someone if they wipe their feet on you. Learn 
        how to stand up for yourself, practice assertive communication, ask and 
        allow others to meet your needs, and take care of yourself as much as 
        you take care of your loved ones. </p>
      <p> <strong>What was wrong can often be made right:</strong><br>
        Problems can be used as lessons; we can choose to learn from them, and 
        find a better way. Each of these relationship wreckers is related to one 
        or more <a href="schemas/">schemas</a>, which are maladaptive patterns 
        of thinking and feeling that are outwardly expressed in negative coping 
        behaviors. These patterns are typically learned in childhood, and get 
        perpetuated and elaborated during one&#8217;s life. Everyone has schemas, 
        both positive and negative. The negative ones were once adaptive, but 
        are no longer appropriate or productive. Self-help and improvement efforts 
        may get you a long way towards where you want to be. In addition, <a href="therapy/cognitive/">Cognitive 
        Therapy</a> and <a href="therapy/schema/">Schema-Focused Therapy</a> are 
        effective treatments for overcoming these patterns by replacing them with 
        new, healthy ways of thinking, feeling and behaving.</p>
