        <p><font face="Arial">Avocado is more than just a tasty treat to be enjoyed in
        guacamole--it makes a hearty satisfying meal when eaten alone, in salads, and in other
        dishes. Most people who transition from a standard American diet to a vegan diet with
        avocado, nuts and seeds don&#146;t miss the animal foods because raw vegan plant fat is so
        satisfying as well as more nutritious than cooked fatty animal foods! In hundreds of
        thousands of cases, people who&#146;ve adopted a vegan diet of predominantly raw foods
        with minimal or no cooked starches as part of a healthful lifestyle (including regular
        exercise and adequate sleep), have lost excess weight, overcome illness, gained new
        vitality, and avoided the killer diseases which now plague our meat, bread, dairy, and
        junk-food eating society. The fresh vitamins, active enzymes, organic minerals, soluble
        fiber, high water content, and easily digested fats and proteins in avocados and other
        fruit and plant foods can help transform any sluggish, overweight meat eater into a
        slimmer and more dynamic person. Some of the leanest people I know eat the most avocados!
        Cooked foods such as bread, pasta, meat, dairy and junk foods are the villains that can
        keep an avocado eater from losing excess fat. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">If your goal is to reduce your consumption or transition completely
        off of meat and dairy, avocado may be the perfect way to satisfy your natural cravings for
        creamy nourishment. Dr. William Esser writes in his Dictionary of Natural Foods: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&#147;The avocado is one of the most valuable foods which nature has
        given man. For those concerned about eliminating meat from their diet, this offers not
        merely a &#147;substitute,&#148; but a food which is much superior in value for human
        maintenance. It is rich in protein and fat and comparatively higher than any other fruits
        in these elements. The fat is more digestible than animal fats.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Avocado is also known as the &#147;alligator pear&#148; because of
        the rough skin on some varieties. In the 17th and 18th centuries the fruit was also
        commonly known as &#147;butter pear.&#148; In tropical Central America, avocado trees have
        been growing wild for thousands of years, providing natives with a rich food. The Aztecs
        called the tree Ahuacatl. Marauding Spanish armies changed this to abocado or avocado, the
        now common English name. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">According to the Little Green Avocado Book, there is strong evidence
        that avocado trees flourished 50 million years ago in what is now California, and avocados
        might have provided food for dinosaurs. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Today&#146;s avocados are derived from three natural races. The
        Mexican type (semi-tropical) produces small fruits, 6 to 10 ounces having glossy purple,
        paper-thin skin when ripe. The Guatemalan type (subtropical) yields medium pear-shaped
        fruits which are first green, turning purple-black or coppery-purple when ripe, with a
        typically tough shell. The West Indian type (tropical) produces enormous, smooth, round,
        glossy green fruits as up to 2 pounds in weight. In the United States, 95 percent of the
        commercially grown avocados come from California, with small percentages coming from
        Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Hawaii. The California Rare Fruit Growers Fruit Facts,
        Volume One, reports that avocados grow well in valley and coastal California, as far north
        as Cape Mendocino and Red Bluff. Hybrid forms of all types are grown. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Avocado growing is relatively new in the United States. They are
        available year round. The harvest time depends on the variety. The Hass, the best known
        commercial variety, is a hybrid of the Mexican and the Guatemalan types and is picked from
        January into fall depending on where it is grown. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Little Green Avocado Book also reports that avocado trees are
        large evergreens of the laurel family, and there are about 400 commercial varieties of
        avocado. Some are: Bacon, Ettinger, Fuerte, Gwen, Hass, Nabal, Pinkerton, Reed and Zutano.
        Mexican types ripen in 6 to 8 months from bloom, Guatemalan types 12 to 18 months. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There are wide differences in the flavors of individual avocados,
        ranging from salty, to nutty, to sweet, with shades in between. If a fruit has been picked
        too early it may be watery and unpalatable. If picked too late, some varieties develop a
        rancid flavor. If a Bacon avocado tastes like bacon, it is rancid. If an avocado has dark
        flesh (rot), compost it and/or salvage the good parts. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">At some farmers markets and produce stores, one can occasionally
        find &#147;Cukes&#148; (also known as &quot;Cocktail&quot; or &quot;Finger&quot;
        avocados), seedless, pickle-shaped avocado fruits which result from improperly pollinated
        flowers. One can also occasionally find miniature avocados which have thin, black edible
        skin and an anise flavor (the Mexicola is one variety)--these make a delightful treat! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Julie Frink, Curator for the Avocado Variety Collection, University
        of California Research Station at Irvine, California, writes: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&#147;I have nearly 20 varieties growing in my yard and the Hass
        variety is always one of the best. Some of the green varieties sold in stores have given a
        bad name to some really fine green skinned fruits. The most inferior tasting avocados have
        either been picked when too immature or they are poor quality pollinator varieties to
        begin with. One of our favorites is the round, green Reed. A perfect Reed on Labor Day is
        a most fantastic treat! So often these wonderful fall avocados are picked and sold in the
        spring when they are watery and tasteless. The green, elongated pear shaped Pinkerton can
        be fantastic if allowed to stay on the tree until full maturity but will be rubbery and
        tasteless if picked too soon.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Little Green Avocado Book also states that an acre of avocado
        trees can yield more food than an acre of any other tree crop. Imagine the ecological
        implications--a perfectly healthful &#147;meaty&#148; food which requires 1/200th or less
        of the acreage needed by the cattle industry for a comparable yield in pounds, posing no
        pollution problems--and no carnage! Worried about mad cow disease?--eat raw avocados,
        seeds and nuts and stay sane and mentally keen! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Avocados are bursting with nutrients--vitamins, A, B-complex, C, E,
        H, K, and folic acid, plus the minerals magnesium, copper, iron, calcium, potassium and
        many other trace elements. Avocados provide all of the essential amino acids (those that
        must be provided by our diet), with 18 amino acids in all, plus 7 fatty acids, including
        Omega 3 and 6. Avocados contain more protein than cow&#146;s milk, about 2% per edible
        portion. Since rapidly growing nursing infants obtain no more than 2% protein from
        mother&#146;s milk, we can safely assume that children and adults do not regularly require
        foods richer in protein than avocado. Our bodies recycle approximately 80% of our protein;
        cooked protein is denatured and largely unusable, thus our protein need is far lower than
        what is taught by conventional dietetics. A small avocado will provide more usable protein
        then a huge steak because cooked protein in meat is deranged and mostly unavailable to our
        liver, the organ which makes all of our body&#146;s protein. There is clear evidence from
        many sources that cooked fatty and high-protein foods are the prime culprit in our
        country&#146;s high rate of cancer, as well as in colitis, Crohn&#146;s disease and many
        other diseases. (I instantly healed up from a long illness, ulcerative colitis, seventeen
        years ago after I stopped eating meat and adopted a properly combined low-fat vegan diet
        of mostly raw fruits and vegetables, and I have since helped over 1,000 people recover
        from similar illnesses.) Ripe, raw organically grown avocados are naturally pure and
        furnish all of the elements we need to build the highest quality protein in our bodies. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The water content of avocado by weight averages 74%. Because avocado
        is a ripe, watery, enzymatically-alive fruit, it ranks as the most easily digested rich
        source of fats and proteins in whole food form. The ripening action of the sun
        &#147;predigests&#148; complex proteins into simple, easily digested amino acids. The fat
        content (by weight) varies from 7 to 26 % according to the variety, averaging 15%.
        Approximately 63% of the fat in avocados is monounsaturated, 20% is polyunsaturated and
        17% is saturated. Avocados are the perfect source of dietary fat--appetizing in their raw
        state, digestible, and pure. Another plus is that avocados have no cholesterol. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Avocado is an alkalinizing food, i.e., the mineral end products of
        metabolism have an alkalinizing effect in the blood and other bodily fluids. Because the
        human body works to maintain a slightly alkaline pH, an alkalinizing diet is the most
        healthful way of eating. Meat, dairy and most raw nuts create acidity in the body--excess
        eating of these causes the leaching of alkalinizing calcium from our bones to buffer the
        acidity, leading to osteoporosis. Dr. Douglas Graham states: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&#147;Current bone density testing has verified loss of calcium from
        the bones after the consumption of just one meat meal. A similar meal containing the same
        amount of protein from plants results in no calcium loss. Fruit and vegetable proteins,
        which supply the complete spectrum of human nutrients, must be considered superior to
        animal protein which are deficient or missing many of our essential nutrients such as
        fiber, vitamin C and a host of phytonutrients and antioxidants.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Avocado eaters who eat a healthful vegan diet typically experience
        more lustrous hair, softer, smoother skin, more pliable nails, fewer joint problems,
        slimmer belly, less body odor, improved mental function and enhanced libido. Upon giving
        up animal meat and dairy, switching to a diet of 75% to 100% raw vegan foods with
        enzymatically-alive &#147;plant meat,&#148; and adopting a healthful lifestyle, a
        multitude of people have reaped amazing health benefits and joyous vitality. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">==================== </font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial">How to eat avocado </font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* The Natural Way -- Using your claws (fingernails), peel off the
        skin. The skin of a naturally ripened avocado will easily spiral off in one to three
        pieces. Try this: slide a whole nude avocado through your lips and eat it slowly. There is
        no more sensual eating experience! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* The Modern Way -- Using a knife, slice an avocado along the
        north-south or east-west axis, then remove the pit. The halves can be sliced into smaller
        segments. The skin can then be peeled off, or you can scoop out the flesh with a spoon.
        Eat plain as a snack or scoop the flesh into a bowl or onto a salad. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* Avocado generally requires approximately one and a half to two
        hours in the stomach to be digested. It digests well if the eater is relaxed, hungry,
        energetic, has an empty stomach and follows proper food combining guidelines. If one eats
        avocado when tired, one may fall asleep. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* For optimum digestion, eat avocado alone or with any
        non-sweet-non-starchy fruit or any non-starchy vegetable food. Eating avocado with leafy
        greens, celery and/or cucumber will enhance the digestive process as additional digestive
        enzymes are secreted. People with weak digestion will generally experience enhanced
        digestion when eating avocado with non-starchy salads as opposed to eating avocado alone. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* Avoid eating avocado with or within 20 minutes of eating sweet
        fruit or drinking sweet fruit juice. The combination of little bit of lemon or grapefruit
        juice with avocado tends to digest well for most people. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* Wait at least 3 hours after eating avocado before eating sweet
        fruit. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* Do not eat avocado with any other kind of oily, fatty or
        high-protein food such as seeds, nuts, coconut, olives, yogurt, cream, cheese or meat.
        Wait several hours between eating these foods, although the ideal is 24 hours. It takes
        several hours to digest and utilize any kind of heavy/oily food, and the body can only
        digest one at a time </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* Some people become sluggish and do not function well when eating
        heavy foods in the morning; it might be best to eat avocado mid-day and after. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* Avoid eating avocado if you are experiencing acid reflux,
        indigestion, sore throat, inflammation or fever. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* Overeating avocados can lead to sluggishness, hyper-acid stomach,
        and skin outbreaks. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* The quantity of avocados that is healthful for you is a function
        of your taste preferences and digestion. Generally, one a day, three to six days per week
        is a good baseline. For best results, tune in to your body&#146;s senses and observe your
        energy levels, digestion and elimination. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">================= </font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial">Avocado Preparation Ideas </font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Transition:</strong><br>
        * Mash avocado (&#147;avo butter&#148;) into baked potatoes.<br>
        * Smear &#147;avo butter&#148; over steamed vegetables.<br>
        * Dollop warmed &#147;avo butter&#148; over hot air popped corn.<br>
        * Spread &#147;avo butter&#148; on whole grain bread and soft corn tortillas<br>
        * Dip baked corn chips into a avo halves, or a bowl of avo pulp.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>All Raw:</strong><br>
        * Halve and pit avocado then scoop (or &#147;dip&#148;) celery, carrot, broccoli,<br>
        bell pepper pieces in and eat as a snack<br>
        * Add to salads--there&#146;s your dressing!<br>
        * Mix with chopped bell pepper, tomato, celery, lemon juice, etc. for<br>
        guacamole or salsa.<br>
        * Party time: slice into spears or chunks, insert toothpicks, and serve<br>
        as hors d&#146;oeuvres. (Who needs cholesterol and fat laden cheese!?)<br>
        * Make veggie &#147;handwiches&#148; or &#147;veggie roll-ups&#148;--place chopped
        veggies,<br>
        sprouts, tomatoes and avocado chunks on lettuce, or kale or cabbage<br>
        leaves, fold them over or roll them up, and enjoy.<br>
        * Add to processed vegetables--veggie slaw, veggie loafs, veggie cakes<br>
        and cookies.<br>
        * Mix into veggie and sprout soups--blend in to make a creamy texture,<br>
        or serve &#147;chunky style.&#148;<br>
        * Make dressings--avo-carrot juice, avo-tomato-celery (add a little<br>
        lemon or grapefruit juice and/or herbs to taste).<br>
        * &#147;Avo butter&#148;--smear a halved avocado over freshly shucked corn on the cob<br>
        * &#147;Avo butter&#148;--spread avocado on Essene (sprouted grain) crackers.<br>
        * Stuff avocado and veggies into cored bell peppers (whole or halved)<br>
        and serve as a &#147;handwich&#148; or other entree.<br>
        <br>
        Note: avocado and starchy foods (e.g., potatoes, bread, grains, corn,<br>
        old carrots) make a &#147;fair&#148; food combination--for optimal digestion, do<br>
        not combine avocado and starchy foods.<br>
        </font><br>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial">============== </font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial">Some extraordinary avocado uses </font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* House plants. Stick toothpicks in the sides of avocado pits and
        set them on the top of a water-filled glass. A plant will sprout forth which can be
        transplanted into a pot after a few weeks. On the Avocado Information Web Site, University
        of California, Cooperative Extension, Dr. Mary Lu Arpaia and Dr. Ben Faber report: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&#147;It is possible to grow an avocado from seed, just don't let it
        dry out. Be aware that the seed is the result of cross-pollination so the resulting tree
        will be different from the tree the fruit came from. For example, if you plant the seed
        from a Hass avocado, the resulting tree will be a cross between a Hass and something
        else... it will NOT be a Hass! Also, keep in mind that avocados planted from seed take
        anywhere from 5 to 13 years+ before they flower and produce fruit. When I start an avocado
        from seed I usually take it right from the fruit, I cut about 1/4&quot; off the tip of the
        seed with a sharp knife, and place the seed in a pot with potting soil with just the
        flat/cut top of the seed showing above the soil. Keep it moist and wait...(time to

        <p><font face="Arial">====================== </font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial">Some avocado myths &amp; facts </font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">1. It&#146;s a vegetable. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: It&#146;s actually an oily berry--a fruit. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">2. It&#146;s high in cholesterol. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: It has no cholesterol. Only animal foods have cholesterol. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">3. It&#146;s high in fat. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: By weight, avocados average 30% easily digestible oily fatty
        acids and approximately 70% water. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">4. Its saturated fat content is dangerous. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: Only about 2.5% of the edible portion of avocado is saturated
        fat, and unheated saturated fat from live plant foods is non-toxic. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">5. It&#146;s fattening. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: It is the cooked starches, meat, dairy and processed sugar in
        people&#146;s diets that feed their fat cells. Most active people who consume avocados as
        part high raw food vegan diet have no problem losing excess fat and staying lean. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">6. It is a tree ripened fruit. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: The avocado doesn't soften on the tree. After dropping or
        picking it must be allowed to soften for 4 to 17 days depending on the variety and ambient
        temperature and humidity. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">7. It is best to ripen it in a bag. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: Not necessary. Keep your weekly supply of avocados on your
        kitchen table, counter or somewhere else in plain sight. Pinch the tops and bottoms each
        morning and when they yield to pressure on both ends they are ripe. Refrigerate the ones
        you are not ready to eat. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">9. It can&#146;t be refrigerated. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: Yes it can. Wrap ripe avocado in plastic or keep it in a
        plastic bag or container. If it is refrigerated for too long some spoiling may result.
        Remove unripened avocado from the refrigerator 2 or 3 days before you intend to eat them. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">10. Keep the seed in to keep the guacamole from turning black. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fact: That is an old wives tale! Wrap it in plastic to keep
        oxidation at bay. </font></p>
