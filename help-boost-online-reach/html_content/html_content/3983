							<div id="recipe-intro"><p>It seems like every culture with a coastline has their version of a seafood stew.  The French have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouillabaisse">bouillabaise</a>, the Portuguese <a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/portuguese_salt_cod_stew_bacalhoada/">bacalhoada</a>, New England "<a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/new_england_fish_chowder/">chowdah</a>" and San Francisco <a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cioppino/">cioppino</a>. In Brazil, they make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moqueca">moqueca</a> (pronounced "mo-KEH-kah"), a stew made with fish, onions, garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, and in the northern state of Bahia, coconut milk.  My first encounter with moqueca was a <a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/salmon_fish_stew_brazilian_style/">salmon version of the stew</a> prepared by Brazilian blogger Fernanda of <a href="http://www.chucrutecomsalsicha.com/">Chucrute com Salsicha</a>. So good!  We love making fish stew, but had never thought to use a base of coconut milk.  Since then, every Brazilian I've met, when the conversation turns to food (as it invariably does), their eyes light up at the mention of moqueca.</p></div>
							

							
							<div id="recipe-intro"><a id="more"></a><p>A few words about this recipe.  First, it's easy.  As exotic as it may sound, you probably have most of the ingredients already in your pantry (you'll want to get fresh fish), and with prep, making rice, the total time involved is less than an hour.  Second, since this is an American blog, we're dealing with ingredients we can get here. True Bahian moqueca is made with a fish caught off the coast of northern Brazil.  In our case, we'll want to use a firm white fish.  I used cod for this batch, which is barely firm enough.  Halibut would hold up better.  You can also add shrimp or other shell fish to this stew.  Palm oil is traditionally used in making moqueca, but it's hard to come by here, so we are using olive oil. Finally, adjust the seasonings to taste! If it doesn't seem flavorful enough to you, you need to add more salt.  And probably a little more lime or lemon juice and paprika too.</p>

<p>To any Brazilians who might be reading this blog (Olé Brasil!) if you have a favorite moqueca recipe, please tell us about it the comments.</p></div>

<ul>
<li class="ingredient">1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
<li class="ingredient">1/2 onion, chopped</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 clove garlic, minced</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 cup white rice</li>

									<h3>Method</h3>
									<p><b>1</b> Place fish pieces in a bowl, add the minced garlic and lime juice so that the pieces are well coated. Sprinkle generously all over with salt and pepper. Keep chilled while preparing the rest of the soup. </p>

<p><b>2</b> If you are planning on serving the soup with rice, start on the rice.  Bring a couple cups of water to a boil.  Heat one Tbsp of olive oil in a medium saucepan on medium high heat.  Add the chopped 1/2 onion and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more, until the garlic is fragrant.  Add the raw white rice and stir to coat completely with the oil, onions, and garlic.  Add the boiling water. (The amount depends on your brand of rice, check the package. If no amounts are given, add 1 3/4 cup of water for every cup of rice.)  Stir in 1 teaspoon of salt.  Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat, cover, and let cook for 15 minutes, after which, remove from heat until ready to serve with the soup.</p>

<p><img src="http://simplyrecipes.com/photos/moqueca-fish-stew-1.jpg" width="210" height="140" alt="moqueca-fish-stew-1.jpg" title="Coat fish in marinade and chill" /><img src="http://simplyrecipes.com/photos/moqueca-fish-stew-2.jpg" width="210" height="140" alt="moqueca-fish-stew-2.jpg" title="Soften onions and peppers" /></p>

<p><b>3</b> Back to the soup. In a large covered pan (such as a Dutch oven), coat the bottom with about 2 Tbsp of olive oil and heat on medium heat.  Add the chopped onion and cook a few minutes until softened.  Add the bell pepper, paprika, and red pepper flakes.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  (At least a teaspoon of salt.) Cook for a few minutes longer, until the bell pepper begins to soften.  Stir in the chopped tomatoes and onion greens.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, uncovered.  Stir in the chopped cilantro.</p>

<p><img src="http://simplyrecipes.com/photos/moqueca-fish-stew-3.jpg" width="210" height="140" alt="moqueca-fish-stew-3.jpg" title="Lay fish on bed of vegetables" /><img src="http://simplyrecipes.com/photos/moqueca-fish-stew-4.jpg" width="210" height="140" alt="moqueca-fish-stew-4.jpg" title="Add more vegetables to top of fish" /></p>

<p><b>3</b> Use a large spoon to remove about half of the vegetables (you'll put them right back in).  Spread the remaining vegetables over the bottom of the pan to create a bed for the fish.  Arrange the fish pieces on the vegetables. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Then add back the previously removed vegetables, covering the fish.  Pour coconut milk over the fish and vegetables.</p>

<p><img src="http://simplyrecipes.com/photos/moqueca-fish-stew-5.jpg" width="210" height="140" alt="moqueca-fish-stew-5.jpg" title="Add coconut milk" /><img src="http://simplyrecipes.com/photos/moqueca-fish-stew-6.jpg" width="210" height="140" alt="moqueca-fish-stew-6.jpg" title="Gently cook" /></p>

<p><b>4</b> Bring soup to a simmer, reduce the heat, cover, and let simmer for 15 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  You may need to add more salt (likely), lime or lemon juice, paprika, pepper, or chili flakes to get the soup to the desired seasoning for your taste.</p>

<p>Garnish with cilantro. Serve with rice or with crusty bread.</p>

		<p>Hello Elise!<br />
I know you will tell me the coconut milk is the key ingredient that makes the Moqueca a true Moqueca but...do you think regular milk will completely spoil the result? I do have a problem with coconut... thx! </p>

<p><em>I would not use regular milk. I would skip it all together if you don't like coconut milk. Or look for another version of moqueca that doesn't require it. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>Very simple recipe. And a very good one. The original has some minor differences, but this is easier to be made in any country. Some suggestions: Chop onions and other vegetables in tiny stripes; better do not use paprika: use a mix of cummin and black pepper (50%/50%) instead.<br />
The original fish for moqueca is Carassius auratus, but cod is - maybe - better :-)</p>

<p><em>Slightly different. I left out the cumin (you could add it back in), and I changed the order of how to cook the ingredients.  Salmon holds up better to longer cooking than cod, so I cook the vegetables first in this recipe and then just cook the fish with them for a short time. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>I'm always up for a recipe that uses coconut milk, so thank you! I've never heard of this one but a favourite Brazilian recipe of mine is Pao de Queijo (sp?), chewy little breads made with tapioca flour. Though I've never been to the American continent, I ate them a lot in Japan where they are popular for their "mochi mochi-ness," a quality highly prized there and found they are easy to make.</p>

		<p>This sounds lovely; unfortunately, coconut milk is far too rich and always makes me feel sick. Could I simply replace the coconut milk with stock, or should I seek out a recipe from one of the regions that does not use it? </p>

<p><em>Most of the discussion I found about the stew made a point to say that no additional liquid was used (unless you are adding coconut milk), the stew releases water as it slowly cooks.  That said, I think you might need to load up on more tomatoes, or add a little clam juice if you leave out the coconut milk. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>Hey, I'm Brazilian and I have a recipe blog (in Portuguese) where I translate some recipes from here and there are others too. Moqueca is a very Brazilian recipe, famous in northeast. There are many kind of Brazilian recipes and, many of them are very very simple, I can give you some tips. :) Nice too see a Brazilian dish here. it's not "olé Brasil" but "olá Brasil". And by the way, this Sunday I made the "Creamy Shrimp and Broccoli Fettuccine", check the pic: <a href="http://bit.ly/bL1YdO" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://bit.ly/bL1YdO" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/bL1YdO</a></a> bye.</p>

		<p>Elise, this looks and sounds amazing.  I am very familiar with the Portuguese version (Bacalhau) as Lenny is from the Azores and we are treated to this wonderful dish whenever we go back to Boston to visit.  I have made a version a couple times.  As well there is the Basque version (Bacalao a la Viscaina) which is slightly different but equally as good (my family is Basque).  One of the things I love about your recipe is that there is the  addition of coconut milk, lime juice and cilantro - three of my favorite things!  Definitely going to be trying out this recipe!</p>

		<p>Hi Elise,<br />
I would say that moqueca and feijoada are the two Brazilian national dishes. I just returned from a 3 week vacation down there and had moqueca for at least a 1/2 a dozen times made in many different ways!<br />
Really yummy!<br />
In the northern state of Bahia they also add Dendê oil which is a type of palm oil as well as Colorau a fragrant pigment extracted from the fruit of a tree (Urucum). It gives the dish that vibrant red color you can get with paprika. I bet there was no leftovers!<br />

		<p>For the question about not using coconut milk, I've made moqueca before and subbed chicken broth instead for a lower calorie version, and it's just as flavorful (tho not an authentic moqueca). Also, it's delish to throw some calamari (that you've marinated like the fish) in the soup at the last minute too.</p>

		<p>This does look delicious.   I like any kind of fish stew.</p>

<p>I wonder -- for the people who have trouble with coconut -- there are other nut milks in the world. Rather than just add more stock, why not take almond milk?  It's not exactly the same flavor, but the mild sweetness is there, and it's creamy in texture but not as rich.  It would resemble the original a little more.  </p>

<p>Here's a simple little recipe posted on line by Dr. Ben Kim:</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<p>1 to 1 ½ cups of raw almonds<br />
4 cups of filtered or spring water<br />
3-8 dates (optional)</p>

<p>Directions:</p>

<p>1. Soak almonds in water for at least six hours.</p>

<p>2. Drain soaked almonds, and blend in a blender with 4 cups of fresh water until you get a milk-like consistency. Blend with dates (that have been soaked for at least an hour) if you like a hint of sweetness to your milk.</p>

<p>3. Strain once to remove almond granules. </p>

		<p>In Iran we have a version of fish stew too. <br />
1 onion<br />
4 garlic cloves<br />
corriander 1 kilo<br />
fenugreek 200 grams<br />
tamarind 200 grams<br />
butter 100 grams<br />
oil 5 grams<br />
fish</p>

<p>Fry the onions and garlic in the oil, add some turmeric,  salt and petter. Then, chop up the fenugreek reallyy small, add that, then the corriander should be chopped up small, then add that too. Then add enough water to cover it, a little bit higher. Soak the tamarind in some water, and pass it through a sieve to get out the seeds. <br />
Next you cut up the boneless fish into small squares, dip it in some flour, and fry it in the butter. Add it to the stew, and let it cook.<br />
Or you could just add tuna fish.</p>

I'm originally from Brazil but I live in the US. I have found palm oil in a small latino store here in DC. My local Whole Foods does not carry it.<br />
My favourite recipe is almost identical to yours, minus the paprika. <br />
I also make crab moqueca and it's delicious. The procedure is pretty much the same. You just use crab instead of fresh fish.<br />
If you are able to find manioc flour in your area, you have to try moqueca with farofa (a side dish made with manioc flour that goes amazingly well with moqueca). <br />

<p>By the way, there's really no reason to fear and avoid (non-hydrogenated) tropical oils.

The chapter "Real Fats" in Nina Planck's <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Food-What-Eat-Why/dp/1596911441" rel="nofollow">Real Food</a></i> has much more.</p>

		<p>Hi all. This is truly a delicious dish, and so versatile, as you can change ingredients based on what you like in terms of seafood.<br />
In my opinion, moqueca without dende oil is not moqueca.  It can be purchased online in many places.  www.dendeoil.com  <br />
I am surprised that no mention was made about the version using soft shell crab (moqueca de siri mole).  Dust the crabs with seasoned flour, sear them quick for firming and coloring. Then follow your favorite recipe. Enjoy!<br />

 The creamy richness of the coconut milk is a much appreciated surprise. The peppers and onions really contribute to a hearty fulfilling meal. I used Cod but next time may try lobster or some other fish.<br />
 I ended up using Jasmin rice and mixed it into the stew/soup, I added an extra cup of tomatoes and used about half the salt.<br />

		<p>Elise,<br />
I am brazilian and your recipe is quite good, really. I have though one warning and one suggestion. The warning: if you're using palm oil, you should not cook it (just add some at the end of the recipe) otherwise it will be too strong. The suggestion: you can do exactly the same thing with scallops! <br />
thanks <br />

		<p>Cool, that recipe was indeed missing in this fantastic blog! Just to add a couple of local details: <br />
Many moquecas in Brazil, specially outside Bahia, don't have coconut milk in it (you can simply ommit it). <br />
Another very important thing is actually the palm oil. I know it's hard to find in the US but if you can, use it, it makes a very big difference. In Bahia, they use a LOT of palm oil in the moqueca, around 200ml (small bottle) for a moqueca like described here.<br />
A very common way to do it in Brazil (maybe more than in the pan like here) is to cook it in the oven. You do it just the same, but place everything in an oven recipient, and cook in the oven for around 50 minutes. The palm oil will form a kind of delicious fine brown crust on the top...</p>

		<p>Hi Elise,</p>

<p>I am Brazilian and I am currently living in The Netherlands. </p>

<p>It was really nice to see a Brazilian dish, so popular in Brazil, here.</p>

<p>Your recipe is exactly the Moqueca Baiana (from Bahia state), besides the fact that the original one goes always with palm oil. But no worries about it. I learnt to do this dish with a friend from Bahia and she told me that sometimes when she prepares this dish for Dutch people that are not very used with the palm oil (that is a strong oil), she prepares at the first time just with olive oil and gradually starts to introduce the palm oil.</p>

<p>I am lucky that here I can easily fine the palm oil. It is not from BR, but it's good enough for the dish. </p>

<p>There is also another kind of Moqueca in Brazil, the Moqueca Capixaba, from Espírito Santo state. This version is made without coconut milk. I've tried this one when I traveled to Espirito Santo.  I prefer the Bahian version, but the Capixaba one is also very good and maybe you would like to try. </p>

<p>If you want I can search for a recipe and translate to English if it's just available in Portuguese.</p>

<p>And, the original recipe goes with coriander, but for those who doesn't like it, It is possible to replace by parsley (I do that :)).</p>

<p>Thanks for spread part of the Brazilian culture. :)</p>

<p><br />

		<p>I had this dish in Brazil many times, at the beach in a tiny village in the northeast. It was so delicious. Every time it was served with a hard-boiled egg!</p>

<p>My favorite was Moqueca de arraia (stingray)! When it is fresh caught, it is amazing.</p>

<p>I want to try to make this dish, but I know it can never be quite the same. Sigh.</p>

		<p>Made this a couple of nights ago and it was a real hit. I'm a huge fan of paprika and the combination with coconut milk is delicious. Used cod (as halibut is not yet in season) and I added another clove of garlic for the marinade.  Out of convenience, I marinaded in a ziplock bag for 4 hours and omitted the red garlic flakes so it wasn't too spicy for my 6 year old.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is definitely a keeper.</p>

		<p>Halfway through the prep for this recipe I asked myself, "what are you doing?  You don't even like bell peppers or cilantro".  <br />
Luckily I kept going and followed the recipe as written.  The result was out of this world!  <br />
My wife couldn't stop raving about it.<br />
Thank you!<br />
My only question...is the lime juice that the fish soaks in meant to be poured in to the soup or is it just a marinade that gets discarded?</p>

		<p>I just finished eating this. I made it for my fiance and we both LOVED it! I used fresh halibut fillet which was expensive ($17 for two people!) but well worth it. Used lime, not lemon. I cut the recipe in half and used one pound of fish. I also used light coconut milk and it was great but will use the real deal next time and not worry about the calories. The rice is excellent. I just put the copy of the recipe in my 'definitely will make again' folder! I did add some cumin as one reader suggested because we like that flavor. Somehow, the salt just seems to disappear and you do need to add lots of it, like Elise said. I wonder why that is. Don't skip the cilantro! My friend made it tonight as well on my suggestion but used fillet of sole which all fell apart, as I would have suspected from earlier comments. </p>

<p>Anyway, this is true heaven in a bowl!!! Man, don't pass this immensely flavorful dish up.</p>

Just discovered your blog this week.  My new lunchtime companion at work!  Thanks so much.  Made this stew last night.  Working on leftovers now.  I used low fat coconut milk which worked well. My girls (7 and 11) loved the creamy flavor which helped pass along the fish. I had lemon juice on hand but I'm sure the lime would enhance it better.  I'll be making it again and have shared it with coworkers. Thumbs up!</p>

		<p>This recipe was so simple and delicious- I added cumin to the veggies- I used 1/2lb of halibut and 1/4 lb shrimp, and used 1/4 C light coconut milk with chicken broth (I had about 1.5 C in the fridge that needed to be used). It was delicious, light but so filling. Thanks Elise- I love your recipes.</p>

I learned that when using tomatoes in a recipe, you scoop out the middle seeds and liquid and only use the outside shell portion.  Is that what you do for this recipe?  Or do you include the middle liquids and seeds?  Thanks!</p>

<p><em>Actually, there is a lot of flavor in the seeds and liquid. Sometimes people get rid of it because they are looking for a very smooth sauce, but in this recipe you don't need to do that. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>This is excellent!  I made it with shrimp and cod, following your directions fairly  closely, and it turned out really well.  </p>

<p>My changes:</p>

<p>-subbed fresh chiles for the red pepper flake;<br />
-used juice of two limes and tossed in the garlic/lime marinade into the stew with the fish;<br />
-added half the garlic to the fish marinade and cooked the remainder with the onions and bell peppers until golden; and<br />
-added cumin, on recommendation of one of the Brazilian commenters.</p>

		<p>Elise, this looks amazing. I love the combination of coconut milk and lime, so I can't wait to give this recipe a try! Question: do you use Kosher or table salt? I find the latter to be much stronger in flavor, and typically only use half the amount I would otherwise use for Kosher salt. Just curious. Thanks for the great recipe idea!</p>

<p><em>We use either kosher or sea salt in cooking. Table salt is a much smaller grain and therefore there's more of it than the other salts when you compare volumes.  I would just salt to taste. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>I tried the recipe substituting some de-boned, skinless chicken thighs cut up into bite-size pieces.  I'm betting this might be considered sacrilegious or worse in Brazil, but it actually came out really good.  I think chicken breast pieces would also work well.  I'll try fish the next time.

		<p>Hi there!<br />
I had this dish at a recent dinner party and it was DIVINE!!  I'd like to make it now at my own house, but one person here HATES cilantro.  Any thoughts on using Thai Basil instead of the cilantro?? <br />
I'm hoping this will work well.  Seems like it would, considering the dish really reminded me of panang curry, anyway!  <br />
Has anyone used basil in this??<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p><em>My heart goes out to anyone who doesn't like cilantro.  Apparently it's a chemical thing, for some people it just tastes like soap.  Great idea on the thai basil.  I think it would be an excellent substitute, but haven't tried it in this recipe.  If you do, please let us know how it turns out! ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>This stew was so good! I made it last night - and my husband was skeptical about it, but he wolfed it down and loved it. I enjoyed the prep, which is a little involved but not hard at all - it really honors each ingredient to cook them all just right (not just throw everything in a pot all at once). The balance between acidic (from the lemon juice and tomatoes) and creamy (from the oil and coconut milk) is incredible. I made the rice, and put two 1/4 cup packed little mounds of rice to one side of the bowl, and dished the soup in beside it. Looked lovely. We drank an inexpensive Vino Verhdi with the stew. We have just enough left over for another dinner, and I can't wait to eat it.</p>
