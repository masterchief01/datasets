					<p>The Lions haven't been relevant since Barry Sanders, and decisions like the one made by Marty Mornhinweg in 2001 may be the poster child of the era in Detroit.</p><p>The head coach entered overtime in a tie with the Chicago Bears, won the coin toss, and elected to kick. His logic seems sound, but in reality was quite twisted.</p><p>Having a kicker currently holding the NCAA record for longest kick (62 yards), you wouldn't think a coach would be worried about wind conditions. However, Mornhinweg elected to kick, thinking having the wind at their backs would give the Lions an advantage.</p><p>The Bears would go on to kick the game-winning field goal before the Lions ever touched the ball on offense. The coin toss decision haunts the nightmares of Lions fans dreaming of a Barry Sanders return.</p>

					<p>From day one, Randy Moss just didn't settle well with the Minnesota Vikings. Chemistry is such an important aspect to team sports, and Moss was destined to cause a violent reaction when he returned.</p><p>This season, following being waived less than a month after returning, Moss surfaced in reports alongside head coach Brad Childress, exposing issues in the locker room and a nasty tirade aimed at the team caterer.&nbsp;</p><p>Childress nearly lost his job after it was revealed he waived Moss without consulting the team owner.</p><p>While the Vikings are struggling mightily in 2010, the last thing they needed was a distraction like Randy Moss.</p>

					<p>In 1999, Mike Ditka had a vision for the New Orleans Saints. He would trade away every single pick the Saints had that year, plus two more the following year, to get the fifth pick of the draft in order to select Texas RB Ricky Williams.</p><p>Williams spent just three seasons with the Saints (1999-2001), who won their first ever playoff game but were then eliminated.</p><p>In 2002, Williams was traded to the Miami Dolphins. That year, he led the NFL in rushing yards (1,853) on his way to the Pro Bowl.</p><p>In 2004, Williams would test positive for marijuana, and would retire from the NFL to go on a hiatus from football devoted to pot smoking.&nbsp;</p><p>The Saints never realized their dreams of riding Williams to the Super Bowl, and Williams wasn't the legendary-back-in-the-making the Saints were hoping for so earnestly.</p>

					<p>In a near-repeat of another pick higher on this countdown, the Blazers repeated past history by drafting another injury-plagued bust.</p><p>In 2007, Portland drafted Greg Oden, a freshman from the Ohio State University with the first overall pick.</p><p>The second pick of the draft? Another freshman by the name of Kevin Durant from the University of Texas. Durant was on his way to a brief stop in Seattle before the team moved to Oklahoma City and became the the Thunder.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oden underwent arthroscopic knee surgery and missed the entire 2007-08 season. To date, picking Oden over Durant is viewed as yet another horrible decision in Portland Trail Blazers franchise history.</p><p>Durant was an instant sensation, has drawn comparisons to Michael Jordan, and has been called the "Kobe Bryant of his generation."&nbsp;</p>
