<p>And when I think Girl Scout cookies, I think of the little triplets who live down the street and always come to our door asking us to buy a box of cookies &#8230; or two &#8230; or ten. I always end up with a million <a href="http://www.littlebrownie.com/cookies/cookiepages/tagalongs.html" target="_blank">Tagalongs</a>. I love Tagalongs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.littlebrownie.com/cookies/cookiepages/thinmints.html" target="_blank">Thin Mints</a> are pretty great, too. Even though I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of mint, I do like it with chocolate &#8212; and  Thin Mints are the epitome of chocolate-mint cookies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve eaten Thin Mints and drank water with them. I&#8217;m also pretty darn sure I&#8217;ve never had that Thin Mint flavor <em>in</em> my water.</p>
<p>But in the natural foods section at Fry&#8217;s, that&#8217;s essentially what I found.</p>
<p>The brand is called <a href="http://www.metromint.com/" target="_blank">Metromint</a>, and it sells mint-flavored water in a rainbow of varieties: cherrymint, lemonmint, orangemint &#8230; and the most intriguing, chocolatemint.</p>
<p>Flavored water is pretty normal. But <em>chocolate</em>-flavored water? I had to try it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually almost positive I&#8217;ve seen this stuff before. Last year in one of my classes, a girl brought in a bottle of &#8220;chocolatemint water,&#8221; and everyone was intrigued. As I recall, she also sat with the girls who everyone suspected brought vodka to class in their water bottles &#8230; so maybe it wasn&#8217;t chocolatemint water after all. But I digress.</p>
<p>I put this stuff in the freezer for an hour or so before I drank it so it would be nice and frosty. When I opened up the bottle and<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mint-water02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-325" title="mint-water02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mint-water02.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> poured some in a glass (just in case anyone else wanted some and was terrified of my cooties), I gave it a cautious sniff.</p>
<p>Wow. Definitely mint. In fact, I could barely smell chocolate &#8212; but it had a strong spearmint scent.</p>
<p><em>Mint water?</em> I thought. <em>I guess that&#8217;s not so weird.</p>
<p></em>I took a generous sip, and I was shocked.</p>
<p>It tasted like &#8230; well, water.</p>
<p>(That was &#8220;well, water,&#8221; people. Not &#8220;well water.&#8221; That&#8217;s an entirely different story.)</p>
<p>I poured myself some more and took several more sips, trying to discern a flavor. I could make out a very, very faint hint of mint (and <em>maybe</em> chocolate), but I suspect that had more to do with the strong smell of the water than its actual taste. There was a slight aftertaste of mint, which reminded me of the toothpaste they use at the dentist&#8217;s office &#8212; only way more subtle.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mint-water03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-326" title="mint-water03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mint-water03.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>I don&#8217;t get it. How can something have such a pungent odor and be next to tasteless? Maybe I just have insensitive taste buds (death by green pepper jelly?). The ingredients say it contains mint and cocoa essence &#8230; does &#8220;essence&#8221; involve briefly setting the bottle next to an unwrapped Hershey&#8217;s bar and hoping it soaks in the ambience? Because that&#8217;s about what it tasted (or didn&#8217;t taste) like, chocolate-wise.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the water has no sugar (or Sucralose, or anything) added. It&#8217;s just naturally flavored (or supposedly flavored) water. So zero calories, zero carbs, zero fat &#8230; and zero guilt.</p>
<p>Except maybe the price tag, that is. $1.50 for a small bottle of water is a little pricey, seeing as technically it&#8217;s just water. But hey, if you&#8217;re willing to pay a little extra for a very, very faint hint of flavor (and the chic factor of carrying around a bottle of mint water), then hey, more power to you.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Purified water, mint and cocoa essence.<br />
<strong>Price: </strong>$1.49 at Fry’s.<strong><br />
Pros:</strong> It&#8217;s refreshing. But then again, it&#8217;s water.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Tastes like water &#8212; er, more accurately, doesn&#8217;t really taste like anything, except a faint aftertaste of dentist&#8217;s-office toothpaste.

<p>Is that weird? That&#8217;s weird, huh?</p>
<p>Well, fine. Not quite, then. But when I look back over some of my more sarcastic blog posts, I feel like I&#8217;m two steps away from yelling at the neighbor&#8217;s snot-nosed kids to get off my lawn. Maybe that&#8217;s what happens after you eat enough green pepper jelly and beet cookies.</p>
<p>So today, I&#8217;m getting in touch with my inner eight-year-old for a change.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my absolute favorite food in the whole wide world was peanut butter sandwiches. Not peanut butter and jelly &#8230; just good ol&#8217; peanut butter on wheat bread, spread nice and thick. (I only ate jelly in the form of <a href="http://www.smuckers.com/products/category.aspx?groupId=2&amp;categoryId=4" target="_blank">Goober</a>, and that was only because the stripes were too cool not to eat.)</p>
<p>Peanut butter sandwiches (no jelly, please and thank you) are still a favorite snack, especially now that my life consists of going to school, coming home and having 10 minutes to eat, and then dashing off to work or whatever else I happen to have going on. Peanut butter sandwiches are a classic.</p>
<p>I never thought I&#8217;d find anything terribly out-of-the-ordinary in the peanut butter aisle. Until I actually looked, that is.</p>
<p>I dragged my boyfriend with me on my food-searching adventure this time, mostly because he&#8217;s the kind of person who thinks things like clam juice are perfectly normal. He&#8217;s that balancing factor when I&#8217;m deciding what to blog about. As open-minded as he is about food, I know of at least one thing he really can&#8217;t stand: white chocolate.</p>
<p>So when I spotted a jar of white chocolate peanut butter and picked it up and showed it to him, his facial expression can only be described as priceless. Well, that and utter disgust.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m a big white chocolate fan. In fact, I love those <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/reeses/products.aspx#/REESE'S-White-Peanut-Butter-Cups" target="_blank">white chocolate Reese&#8217;s</a> &#8212; they&#8217;re one of my favorite kinds of candy. But seeing white-chocolate-flavored peanut butter took me back to my high school days.</p>
<p>See, there was this kid at lunch who, almost without fail, would always bring chocolate peanut butter sandwiches. He literally spread peanut butter on once slice of white bread, then took the other slice and drizzled a heaping amount of <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/pure-products/hersheys-syrup/chocolate.aspx" target="_blank">Hershey&#8217;s syrup</a> onto it. By the time lunch rolled around, the syrup had soaked into the bread. I could never decide if this was absolutely revolting or absolutely wonderful, until the day he offered me a bite and I tried it for myself.</p>
<p>I will never forget that horrendous moment. I don&#8217;t think I ate anything involving Hershey&#8217;s syrup for a very long time after that.</p>
<p>So when I saw the white chocolate peanut butter, my mind wrestled with my instincts. My mind told me it would be good, like<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/whitechoco-pb02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-318" title="whitechoco-pb02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/whitechoco-pb02.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> those Reese&#8217;s cups. My instincts told me that this was nasty lunch sandwich, Take 2, and I should stay far away.</p>
<p>My mind won out. Kind of. It was really more that sick curiosity  &#8211; the one that compels me to watch horror movies and regret it later.</p>
<p>The outside of the jar (can I even call it a jar, since it&#8217;s plastic?) says, &#8220;Try me with pears.&#8221; I hated to disobey, but I don&#8217;t have any pears and didn&#8217;t think to actually read the jar &#8212; er, jar-ish thing &#8212; before leaving the store. So instead, I tried it the good, old-fashioned way: on a piece of wheat bread.</p>
<p>The peanut butter had an oily, kind of grainy consistency, which is pretty consistent &#8212; no pun intended &#8212; with natural peanut butters. (Since this was, after all, &#8220;no-stir natural&#8221; peanut butter. It&#8217;d better be, with the arm, leg and firstborn child I paid in exchange for the measly 16-ounce container.)</p>
<p>It smelled just like regular peanut butter, with no hint of white chocolate. But smells can be deceiving. I spread a generous amount on a slice of bread, lifted it to my mouth, and took a bite.</p>
<p>I was immediately transported back to that fateful lunch period in junior high, and I almost wanted to cry.</p>
<p>But once I pushed past the memory that the disturbingly sickly sweet taste brought to mind, I started to realize that this stuff actually tastes really, really good.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/whitechoco-pb03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-319" title="whitechoco-pb03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/whitechoco-pb03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>It doesn&#8217;t quite taste like white chocolate Reese&#8217;s, I&#8217;m sorry to say. But the sweetness of the white chocolate balanced out the nuttiness of the natural peanut butter quite nicely.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t recommend eating it in a sandwich, especially not with jelly. (And that&#8217;s not just because I don&#8217;t like jelly.) It&#8217;s a little (er, a lot) too sweet for that. But I can imagine it tasting good on pears, like the &#8230; jar thing &#8230; recommends, and it would probably be pretty yummy on graham crackers as a quasi-healthy snack.</p>
<p>Oh, and the best part? Speaking of quasi-healthy, the peanut butter is made with evaporated cane juice. There&#8217;s no Sucralose in this one &#8212; not this time.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Peanuts, evaporated cane juice, vanilla, cocoa butter, palm fruit oil, lecithin (from sunflowers) and salt.<br />
<strong>Price: </strong>$4.49 at Fry&#8217;s Marketplace.<strong><br />
Pros:</strong> Kinda like a Reese&#8217;s. Kinda. Plus it&#8217;s all-natural and has a refreshingly short ingredients list.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Junior-high lunches involving chocolate syrup and peanut butter sandwiches.

You wouldn&#8217;t believe the number of times I hear, &#8220;So are you 15 or 16?&#8221; or &#8220;What year of high school are you in?&#8221; I&#8217;ll be 20 this year, thank you very much, and technically I&#8217;m a junior. In <em>college</em>.</p>
<p>People tell me I&#8217;ll appreciate it when I&#8217;m 50. I guess so.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, in the event that my eternal youth proves to be not-so-eternal, there&#8217;s apparently a canned drink that will restore it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;<a href="http://www.selfbeautyelixir.com/2009/" target="_blank">Self</a>,&#8221; which seems narcissistic at best and redundant at worst, but I&#8217;ll roll with it. I found it at Sprouts among the &#8220;healthy energy drinks&#8221; and all that other stuff that may or may not work (but probably doesn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s produced by <a href="http://www.hansens.com/" target="_blank">Hansen&#8217;s</a>, which makes those amazing <a href="http://www.hansens.com/products/products.php?cat=1" target="_blank">all-natural sodas</a> that I love so much &#8230; so that in itself made the drink sound promising.</p>
<p>They market it as a &#8220;beauty elixir,&#8221; which reminded me of wizards and alchemy and didn&#8217;t help quite as much with the promising factor.</p>
<p>There were three flavors on the shelf &#8212; tropical bliss, pink lemonade and blushing berry &#8212; and I went with blushing berry<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/beauty-elixir02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-310" title="beauty-elixir02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/beauty-elixir02.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> because it sounded the most cryptic. I mean, what kind of berries are we talking about &#8230; and why are they blushing, exactly?</p>
<p>The side of the can reads, &#8220;Revitalize your inner beauty with a sexy blend of exotic berries, botanical extracts, nutrients and antioxidants!&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure how berries can be sexy, but I was intrigued nonetheless.</p>
<p>I opened it up and poured it into a glass (after giving the pretty blue tab to my little sister to put in her shoelace &#8230; I&#8217;m honestly not sure why). &#8220;Blushing&#8221; was a good adjective after all &#8212; the juice had a pale pink color like &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, embarrassed water or something. It actually looked a little gross.</p>
<p>But when I took a sip, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>It reminded me of raspberry lemonade somehow, which doesn&#8217;t make much sense because there&#8217;s no lemon in it, but it had the same sweet-and-sour taste.  The aftertaste wasn&#8217;t so great, though: a couple of seconds after taking a sip, I could tell for certain that the juice was made with <a href="http://tuberose.com/Sucralose.html" target="_blank">Sucralose</a>. A quick glance at the ingredients confirmed it.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/beauty-elixir03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-311" title="beauty-elixir03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/beauty-elixir03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Now, maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I don&#8217;t buy into the whole chemical-sugar-substitute thing. Give me pure cane juice any day, but keep Splenda away from me. I can taste a difference, and it&#8217;s not a good thing. Sucralose, to me, tastes nothing like sugar &#8212; and I&#8217;m not a fan of chemical substitutes to begin with.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the drink does contain natural flavors, lots of juice concentrates, green tea extract and other extracts that are apparently chock-full of <a href="http://www.healthcastle.com/antioxidant.shtml" target="_blank">antioxidants</a>. (It also has only 35 calories in the whole can &#8212; thanks to the Sucralose, I&#8217;m sure.)</p>
<p>I suppose all this could <em>technically</em> make you look younger &#8230; or at least more revitalized and rejuvenated (it&#8217;s Big Word Day), but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m buying into it. It tastes OK, it contains some good stuff &#8230; but I&#8217;d rather drink water and eat a banana every day, or whatever it is you&#8217;re supposed to do to keep the wrinkles away. This juice might be a better alternative to lemonade or soda, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s exactly what <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/J002678F/ponce_de_leon.htm" target="_blank">Juan Ponce de León</a> was looking for.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> An infusion of reverse-osmosis water; apple juice concentrate; natural flavors; citric acid; vitamin E; ascorbic acid (vitamin C); blackberry, blueberry, red raspberry, strawberry and cranberry juice concentrates; fruit and vegetable extract (for color); Sucralose; acerola extract; chamomile flower extract; vitamin A; zinc sulfate monohydrate; niacinamide (vitamin B3); green tea extract; D-calcium pantothenate (vitamin B5); cocoa powder extract; vitamin B6; açai concentrate; mangosteen extract; pomegranate concentrate; biotin; selenium; vitamin B12.<br />
<strong>Price: </strong>$1.49 at Sprouts.<strong><br />
Pros:</strong> Only 35 calories per can; lots of antioxidants; tastes &#8230; decent.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Sucralose. Yuck.

					<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/muffin-tops01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-302" title="muffin-tops01" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/muffin-tops01.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The other day, I was wandering through Fry&#8217;s searching for unconventional food, when I came upon a treasure trove: the organic section. Whether it&#8217;s new or I&#8217;ve just been completely oblivious to it until now, I&#8217;m not sure, but I&#8217;d definitely hit the jackpot. Now, I&#8217;m not saying that natural food in general is weird &#8212; I love most organic food &#8212; but there&#8217;s definitely some not-so-normal stuff out there.</p>
<p>Take <a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" href="http://www.vitalicious.com/store-vitatops.html" target="_blank">VitaTops</a>, for instance: muffins that have two-thirds of their muffiny goodness missing, leaving only &#8230; a muffin top.</p>
<p>I could make so many jokes. But for your sake, I&#8217;ll refrain.</p>
<p>VitaTops are apparently the amputee cousins of <a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" href="http://www.vitalicious.com/store-vitamuffins.html" target="_blank">VitaMuffins</a>, which are low-calorie (whole) muffins. VitaMuffins have 100 calories. VitaTops have 100 calories. Yet VitaTops are missing the crucial bottom part of the muffin, hence the name.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m confused. Did Vitalicious (the company that makes these &#8212; I see a &#8220;vitamin&#8221; theme here) decide to saw off more than half of the muffin and stuff all the calories into the top? What&#8217;s the point? Why not give people the whole muffin &#8212; or at least cut down the number of calories in the muffin tops?</p>
<p>According to the website, VitaTops are &#8220;more convenient to carry and eat on-the-run.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know &#8230; I felt kind of gypped when I<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/muffin-tops02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-304" title="muffin-tops02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/muffin-tops02.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> paid nearly 6 dollars for a box of muffin tops when I could&#8217;ve had whole muffins. Still don&#8217;t see the point.</p>
<p>Ah, life&#8217;s little mysteries. Despite my indignation at the price, I went ahead and bought the muffin tops &#8212; &#8220;deep chocolate&#8221; flavored ones, since I figured if I was paying that much for pieces of muffins, I might as well get something that sounded tasty.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re supposed to be kept frozen, which I guess is less worrisome than them being non-perishable, because it probably means they have fewer preservatives. This morning, I opened the box and took out a muffin top: a nice little individually wrapped frozen puck. Yum.</p>
<p>The package said to heat it up for 18 seconds, so I did. After that, it was a nice little individually wrapped warm puck.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/muffin-tops03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-303" title="muffin-tops03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/muffin-tops03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Coincidentally, my boyfriend bought me a chocolate chip muffin last night that I still hadn&#8217;t eaten by breakfast, so I put the two side-by-side for comparison&#8217;s sake. The real muffin made the puck look really pathetic. If I, in all my 5-foot-3 glory, stood next to Kobe Bryant, it might have the same effect.</p>
<p>Despite its (lack of) size, the muffin top did look good. I bit into it, expecting it to be warm and gooey &#8230; and part of it was. But the center was still frozen solid.</p>
<p>18 seconds in the microwave, my foot.</p>
<p>I put it in for another 10, and the results were much better. I took a bite, and then another bite, and then another &#8230; and within a minute, it was gone.</p>
<p>Yes, folks, that&#8217;s a good sign.</p>
<p>In spite of the slightly ridiculous fact that a VitaTop is only part of a muffin with the same number of calories as a <em>whole</em> muffin, these are still really good. (At least the &#8220;deep chocolate&#8221; ones are &#8212; other flavors include golden corn, banana nut and raisin bran.) Six dollars is slightly pricey for a box of 12, since they&#8217;re small, but they make a nutritious morning snack, and they taste like the real thing.</p>
<p>And, since the muffin tops only have 100 calories, if you eat them, you might be able to get rid of that muffin top.</p>
<p>There. I said it.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Water, whole wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice, egg whites, chocolate chips (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, vanilla), cocoa (processed with alkali), soy fiber, erythritol, inulin, dried honey, wheat gluten, leavening (sodium acid pyrophosphate, potassium bicarbonate), fruitrim (grape juice, brown rice syrup), tricalcium phosphate, natural flavor, sea salt, xanthan gum, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, folic acid, iron, biotin and zinc.<br />
<strong>Price: </strong>$5.69 at Fry&#8217;s<strong><br />
Pros:</strong> 100 calories; lots of vitamins; tastes good; convenient snack (what with the individual wrapping and all).<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Muffin tops. Just the tops. I&#8217;d rather have a whole muffin.

					<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cake-yogurt01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-295" title="cake-yogurt01" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cake-yogurt01.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>When I&#8217;m scouting grocery stores looking for out-of-the-ordinary items, I rarely think to look in the dairy section. I mean, what is there to find? Skim milk? Cheddar cheese? I&#8217;ve always assumed the strangest thing there is goat&#8217;s milk, and that&#8217;s not strange enough at all.</p>
<p>But this time, just for kicks and giggles, I made a stop in the dairy section. I&#8217;d never realized before just how many flavors of <a href="http://www.yoplait.com/products/" target="_blank">Yoplait</a> yogurt exist &#8212; but man, I could probably live on yogurt for a week and not get tired of it, since I&#8217;d be eating a different kind for every meal.</p>
<p>Speaking of yogurt flavors, some of them were a little abnormal. Strawberry cheesecake? Chocolate mousse? Weird, but not weird enough to blog on.</p>
<p>But two of them caught my eye: Boston creme pie and black forest cake.</p>
<p>My sister was with me as my shopping buddy (because I&#8217;m socially awkward and can&#8217;t shop alone, remember?), and she adamantly claimed the Boston creme pie yogurt. Apparently she&#8217;s had it before, and she says it&#8217;s incredible. I decided to take her word for it.</p>
<p>But we both had the same reaction to the black forest cake yogurt: What on earth? <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Obviously I bought it.</p>
<p>Not only was the yogurt cake-flavored, it was also <em>light</em>. Now, &#8220;light&#8221; things might be good for you, but in my experience (Diet Coke, low-fat cheesecake, Spam&#8230;), anything that&#8217;s either had most of the fat or most of the sugar taken out of it doesn&#8217;t taste half as good. (Clearly I&#8217;m not the most health-conscious eater. I like to enjoy my life sometimes.)</p>
<p>Now, about this crazy yogurt. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest_cake" target="_blank">Black forest cake</a> is a chocolate cake made with <a href="http://www.drinkfocus.com/articles/liqueurs/kirschwasser.php" target="_blank">Kirschwasser</a> (cherry brandy) and filled with cherries. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever eaten it &#8212; at least not that I can recall &#8212; but it sounds delicious.</p>
<p>But honestly, who makes yogurt that tastes like chocolate-cherry cake? I wasn&#8217;t sure how I felt about this.</p>
<p>Time to try it.</p>
<p>I peeled back the classic Yoplait foil lid and looked inside. The color &#8212; a gloomy grayish-pink &#8212; was definitely not appetizing. It<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cake-yogurt02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-296" title="cake-yogurt02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cake-yogurt02.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> reminded me of brains somehow.</p>
<p>And oh no, was that a <em>chunk</em>?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stand chunks in yogurt. I don&#8217;t know why, but I&#8217;ve always had texture issues with food. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m picky &#8230; just that I&#8217;m weird. Whenever I eat yogurt with fruit in it &#8212; even yogurt I love, like strawberry or raspberry &#8212; I have to either take the chunks out or eat around them. It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing.</p>
<p>But this time &#8212; just for you, dear reader &#8212; I scooped out a heaping spoonful of yogurt, <em>with chunks</em>. You should feel really special.</p>
<p>The yogurt was much more liquid than most other Yoplait yogurts I&#8217;ve eaten, but that might be because it was light &#8230; or because I normally get <a href="http://www.yoplait.com/products/yoplait-whips-yogurt" target="_blank">Whips</a>, since they&#8217;re deliciously non-chunky.</p>
<p>At any rate, I lifted the quivering gray-pink (and chunky) mass to my mouth and ate it slowly, trying to savor it.</p>
<p>Conclusion? &#8230; I couldn&#8217;t decide what to think.</p>
<p>For one thing, the chunks weren&#8217;t really chunky, which was a nice relief for me (and my gag reflex). I&#8217;m pretty sure they were actually little pieces of cake &#8230; or low-fat imitation cake, or something.</p>
<p>But the yogurt didn&#8217;t taste like cake. In fact, it barely tasted like cherry.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cake-yogurt03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-297" title="cake-yogurt03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cake-yogurt03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>If I hadn&#8217;t seen the label, I would&#8217;ve thought it was raspberry yogurt, with maybe a bit of cherry flavor mixed in. No chocolate, just fruit. And a not-so-pleasant sour aftertaste.</p>
<p>I made my mom try it, and her reaction was that it reminded her of cheesecake. I definitely didn&#8217;t get that impression, which makes me wonder if there&#8217;s something wrong with my mother&#8217;s taste buds (or mine). But the fact of the matter is, she liked it. She even volunteered to eat the rest.</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t terribly impressed by it. There are better yogurt flavors out there, for sure. I was also disappointed because it didn&#8217;t taste as disgusting as I thought it would, so I don&#8217;t have much complaining to do today, which is a little sad for me.</p>
<p>Bottom line: If you like sour fruity yogurt with strange non-chunky chunks in it, pick this up. If you&#8217;re looking for yogurt that really tastes like chocolate-cherry cake, however, you&#8217;re better off baking a black forest cake and throwing it in a blender with some milk.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Cultured, pasteurized Grade-A nonfat milk; high fructose corn syrup; modified corn starch; cherries; nonfat milk; kosher gelatin; citric acid; malic acid; Aspartame; tricalcium phosphate; potassium sorbate added to maintain freshness; natural and artificial flavor; Red #40, vitamin A acetate; Blue #1, vitamin D.<br />
<strong>Price: </strong>$0.50 at Wal-Mart<strong><br />
Pros:</strong> Tastes like fruit. Always a good sign in yogurt that&#8217;s at least sort of meant to be fruit-flavored. Oh, and it&#8217;s pretty cheap.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn&#8217;t taste like cake. Sad day.

					<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pumpkinpoptarts01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-280" title="pumpkinpoptarts01" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pumpkinpoptarts01.jpg?w=300&#038;h=202" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a>I was all set to go out searching today for the perfect food to blog about. Turns out I didn&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>I was rummaging through the pantry in search of dinner when I came across a jumbo box of <a href="http://www.poptarts.com/#/26">Pop-Tarts</a> labeled &#8220;pumpkin pie.&#8221; Apparently my mom bought them earlier today for my sister, who begged and pleaded and gave her puppy-dog eyes.</p>
<p>Score.</p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t even have to go shopping this time around &#8212; which makes it seem like I&#8217;m lazy or a recluse. Both are probably true.</p>
<p>It almost feels like a cop-out, since I love both pumpkin pie and Pop-Tarts, but hey, I started classes this week &#8212; it’s a wonder I’m taking the time <del>away from my hated bio homework</del> to blog at all.</p>
<p>Plus, pumpkin pie and Pop-Tarts, while they make for a great alliteration, don’t necessarily sound like the most delicious combination out there. Nor the most obvious combination &#8212; I mean, who eats pumpkin pie for breakfast?  Besides me, I mean.</p>
<p><a href="http://www2.kelloggs.com/">Kellogg&#8217;s</a> does a lot of strange things with their toaster pastries (e.g. flavoring them like strawberry milkshakes), but usually their<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pumpkinpoptarts021.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-282" title="pumpkinpoptarts02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pumpkinpoptarts021.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a> efforts turn out well (e.g. strawberry-milkshake Pop-Tarts).</p>
<p>But &#8220;frosted pumpkin pie&#8221; is just a little strange.</p>
<p>Time to give it a try. I ripped open the foil package &#8212; which has always frustrated me because they put two pastries inside each package, like they automatically expect you to be a pig and eat both. And if you don&#8217;t eat both, you&#8217;re forced to find a little baggie to save the second one in, since now you&#8217;ve destroyed its packaging to get to the first one. I feel like Pop-Tarts need an announcement on the front of the boxes: &#8220;Individually wrapped &#8230; sort of.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pulled out one pastry (and found a little baggie for the other) and bit into it. Another pet peeve about Pop-Tarts (even though I love them anyway): The crusty edges are always so dry. They need to make crustless Pop-Tarts, like that <a href="http://www.packagingdigest.com/photo/150/150154-0702fmi236.gif">crustless bread</a> my mom always refused to buy me when I was a kid no matter how much I complained.</p>
<p>Once I found the actual filling, I was able to get a better idea of what the Pop-Tart was supposed to taste like. Well &#8230; sort of able to. For as strong as pumpkin-flavored things usually are, this was surprisingly weak. I could definitely taste the spices, but the pumpkin flavor was almost entirely in the aftertaste.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pumpkinpoptarts03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-283" title="pumpkinpoptarts03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pumpkinpoptarts03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I don&#8217;t know why, but that made me kind of sad. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m the kind of person who heaps extra frosting on my cake and prefers my Oreos double-stuffed. But whatever the case, the minuscule amount of filling in the PopTart was really disappointing. Especially because it was supposed to taste like pie. I like pie.</p>
<p>I finished the pastry &#8212; which I don&#8217;t always do with everything I try, so that&#8217;s an indication that it was at least OK. And that&#8217;s exactly what it was: not great, but good enough.</p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve liked to have seen a bit more filling in these, but maybe that&#8217;s just me being picky. If you&#8217;re a pumpkin liker and not a pumpkin lover, I&#8217;m sure these will work great for you. But if you eat pie for breakfast and you&#8217;re expecting these to be a perfect substitute, you should probably just stick to pie.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate [Vitamin B1], riboflavin [Vitamin B2], folic acid), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, soybean and palm oil (with TBHQ for freshness), dextrose, sugar, cracker meal, contains 2 percent or less of wheat starch, nonfat milk, salt, pumpkin, maltodextrin, cornstarch, corn cereal, leavening (sodium acid pyrophosphate, baking soda, monocalcium phosphate), molasses, yellow corn flour, eggs, gelatin, cinnamon, vanilla extract, modified cornstarch, nutmeg, ginger, caramel color, sunflower lecithin, tricalcium phosphate, soy lecithin, cloves, Vitamin A palmate, niacinamide, reduced iron, Yellow #6, pyridoxine, hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Yellow #5, thiamin hydrochloride (Vitamin B1), Red #40, folic acid and Blue #1.<br />
<strong>Price: <span style="font-weight:normal;">$3.42 at Wal-Mart (16 in box)</span><br />
Pros:</strong> Pumpkin pie &#8230; ish. Portable pie, in a way &#8212; if you&#8217;re a morning-pie person and you hate the fact that you always spill your pie all over yourself on your way to work, these are a good idea.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn&#8217;t really taste like pie. So don&#8217;t expect a lot.

<p>One reason for this was because I wanted to be the first person to walk on Mars. The other reason was because I really, really wanted to eat freeze-dried food in space.</p>
<p>Now, I know they sell freeze-dried ice cream sandwiches in just about every space-themed gift shop out there. I know this because I went to a lot of those back in the day. But for whatever reason, I never, ever bought one &#8230; or anything else freeze-dried, for that matter.</p>
<p>Earlier today, my boyfriend and I were shopping at <a href="http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/">Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse</a> for a backpacking trip we&#8217;re going on this weekend. Now I know that&#8217;s not really a grocery store, and they barely even have food, but they do have an entire freeze-dried section. The little kid in me was drawn to it like flies to honey. Or is it vinegar?</p>
<p>Anyway. They had everything, from mac &#8216;n cheese to vegetable lasagna &#8212; and they even sold ice cream sandwiches. But what really caught my eye was the blueberry cheesecake.</p>
<p>When someone says &#8220;blueberry cheesecake,&#8221; my first thought is not &#8220;a bag full of powdery stuff.&#8221; (And when someone says &#8220;a bag full of powdery stuff,&#8221; I generally take that as a drug reference. But I digress.)</p>
<p>Cheesecake is my weakness. I&#8217;d never tried freeze-dried food. This was a necessity.</p>
<p>Once I got home, making the cheesecake was an adventure in and of itself. (Maybe that&#8217;s the real reason campers eat it.) Inside<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cheesecake02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-270" title="cheesecake02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cheesecake02.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a> the big bag were three smaller packets &#8212; one of cheesecake powder, one of blueberry-topping powder and one of graham-cracker crumblies. Yum, yum.</p>
<p>The only major step was adding water &#8212; one cup of cold water to the cheesecake, 1/4 cup of hot water to the blueberries. The big bag served as a bowl for the cheesecake mix, which is nice and innovative. The not-so-innovative part of the process was the fact that the little blueberries still needed a bowl (which resourceful campers would hopefully have anyway), and also the fact that the packets were impossible to rip open. So if you take this on a camping trip, bring a knife or something.</p>
<p>The cheesecake took 10 minutes to set, which was terrible for me because the stuff smelled so delicious.</p>
<p>When the suspenseful wait was over, I eagerly opened the bag. The contents looked nothing like cheesecake, except for the color. The stuff had the consistency of pudding.</p>
<p>But it definitely smelled like cheesecake, and that was all I cared about.</p>
<p>I spooned it out (note to campers: bring a spoon) onto a plate (oh yeah, and bring a plate), sprinkled the graham-cracker crumbs over it and heaped blueberry gunk on top.</p>
<p>It looked nothing like a cheesecake &#8212; in fact, it looked like someone plopped pudding onto a plate and decorated it &#8212; but it smelled heavenly. This was one food I was actually excited to eat. (And because of that, I ate it with my eyes open, of course.)</p>
<p>The taste didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had <em>real</em> cheesecake that wasn&#8217;t half as good as this. It was sweet, rich and bursting with flavor. (Literally bursting, in the case of the blueberries.)</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cheesecake03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-271" title="cheesecake03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cheesecake03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>The downside to the sweet richness was that I could barely eat four or five spoonfuls before it was just too much. Not that it was ever <em>bad</em>, but it&#8217;s one of those foods you nibble for awhile and then save for later. (Or, if you&#8217;re less selfish than I am, you share it &#8212; since, after all, it <em>is </em>supposed to feed four.)</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a good thing I never became an astronaut, because I don&#8217;t think I could eat this stuff in space. I think it would float around the room in giant globs that I would have to chase around like a demented fish, and that would just be bad. But I can definitely eat it here on earth, and I can definitely take it camping with me as long as I have the right utensils and dishes.</p>
<p>So freeze-dried cheesecake, while it doesn&#8217;t sound like it could possibly be as good as its &#8220;normal&#8221; counterpart, is actually surprisingly better-tasting than a lot of cheesecake I&#8217;ve tried &#8212; and it comes in a convenient little pouch that you can keep in your pantry or stuff under your pillow or something.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> You know what? The ingredients list takes up half of the back of the package, so for your sake and the sake of my poor fingers, I&#8217;m going to link you. <a href="http://www.mtnhse.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=M&amp;Product_Code=53542&amp;Category_Code=MHD">Here you go</a> &#8212; just find the &#8220;nutrition and ingredients&#8221; link on that page.<br />
<strong>Price:<span style="font-weight:normal;"> $5.99 at Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse</span><br />
Pros:</strong> Rich, sugary, cheesecake-y goodness.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> You can&#8217;t really eat it in space, which is kind of a bummer.

<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/spam01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-264" title="spam01" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/spam01.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>In sixth grade, I went on a field trip to some space center, and I had a peanut butter sandwich for lunch.</p>
<p>Some kid sitting by me obviously had a loving mother (only not), because he reached into his lunchbox and pulled out a <a href="http://www.spam.com/">Spam</a> sandwich, complete with Velveeta cheese.</p>
<p>He looked at me. “Wanna trade?”</p>
<p>“Um &#8230; no thanks. I’m good.”</p>
<p>Ever since then, the only contact I’ve had with Spam has been in my e-mail inbox and my Facebook wall (thanks to app-happy acquaintances &#8212; you know who you are).</p>
<p>I pass Spam frequently in the grocery store &#8212; emphasis on the word <em>pass</em>.</p>
<p>But then I came across <a href="http://www.spam.com/products/litesingles.aspx">Spam Singles</a>.  Now, I wouldn&#8217;t date Spam either, so I&#8217;m not shocked that it&#8217;s single, but I did feel a little twinge of pity when I saw it on the shelf all by itself. So I picked it up.</p>
<p>This particular Spam Single also happened to be &#8220;lite.&#8221;<em> Oh good,</em> I thought, <em>Spam is healthy now</em>. (&#8230; Right.)</p>
<p>The front of the package shows it tossed in a leafy cucumber salad, which sounded tempting (well, for Spam), but I figured I&#8217;d<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/spam02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-265" title="spam02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/spam02.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a> better try it by itself. The back of the package suggested frying it, which didn&#8217;t actually sound too bad. But first, as always, I needed to try it raw.</p>
<p>I slid (yes, slid) it out of its package, and it flopped onto my plate in a sticky slab. Wonderful.</p>
<p>My dad, who was watching me for the entertainment value of my facial expressions, chose at that moment to inform me that he thinks Spam tastes like bologna.</p>
<p>I hate bologna.</p>
<p>His response was, &#8220;Tough; you&#8217;re about to eat that stuff anyway,&#8221; and it brought back memories of childhood dinners.</p>
<p>Cringing a little, I sliced off a corner of the cold slab and put it in my mouth.</p>
<p>Good news: It didn&#8217;t exactly taste like bologna.</p>
<p>Bad news: It tasted like several slices of bologna after being puréed by a food processor and molded into a slab, with some extra salt thrown in. Not good. Not at all.</p>
<p>I then made the mistake of asking my dad what was even <em>in</em> Spam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pig parts,&#8221; he replied with a smug grin, obviously enjoying the facial expression that elicited from me.</p>
<p>As disgusted as I was already, I still needed to fry a piece of the stuff. Maybe it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if it were fried, I thought. In fact, it was thick enough that I could probably cook it medium-rare, like I eat my steak.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/spam03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-266" title="spam03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/spam03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>That&#8217;s actually what I did, though not exactly on purpose. I left it on the griddle for a good amount of time on moderate heat, and all that happened was the edges got really crispy and the inside just got warm.</p>
<p>It looked like a chunk of the aftermath of a pig stepping on a grenade, but I ate it anyway.</p>
<p>It tasted much less like bologna and a tiny bit more like ham &#8230; but really just like a butter-fried shell with something warm and gooey and vaguely meaty inside.</p>
<p>It was palatable. More so than raw Spam, at least.</p>
<p>If I were stuck in a bunker during a nuclear winter and I had no other choice, I’d eat a Spam Single.  But I’d fry it first.  And before it got to that point, I’d eat my dog.</p>
<p>Down, PETA, down.  I don’t even have a dog.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>None listed, which is actually really disconcerting. I&#8217;m going to guess we&#8217;re all better off not knowing, though.<br />
<strong>Price:</strong> $1.59 at Albertsons<br />
<strong>Pros:</strong> Doesn&#8217;t need to be refrigerated, so it&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re stocking up for the zombie apocalypse and you don&#8217;t like Ramen noodles like normal people do. It&#8217;s also conveniently packaged to plop on top of a sandwich, if you hate your children. Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s gluten-free.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Spam. It&#8217;s single for a reason.

<p>I was dangerously close to becoming addicted to apple juice, and those little boxes were the perfect containers to drink it out of: portable and convenient. But they were only big enough to last all of three minutes, tops &#8212; which is where the hate portion of the relationship came in.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just apple juice that I drank out of those boxes, though. I had fruit punch, grape juice, cranberry juice&#8230;</p>
<p>But never, ever milk.</p>
<p>So when I came across little milk-filled boxes sitting on the shelf, two things came to mind:</p>
<p>1.) That hardly looks legitimate.</p>
<p>2.) Wait a second. Isn&#8217;t milk supposed to be refrigerated?</p>
<p>As far as legitimacy goes, what concerned me the most was the Comic Sans text slapped across the side of the front of each carton: &#8220;R U thirsty???&#8221;  Uh, R U ten years old? The only plausible explanation for this slogan is that the company is trying really hard to market their product to grade-schoolers by using rudimentary chatspeak and excessive question marks in order to appear trendy. (And I mean &#8220;trendy&#8221; loosely, like oh-dear-Lord-my-mom-is-wearing-leggings-with-Uggs kind of trendy. So basically &#8230; not.)</p>
<p>As far as why milk was sitting out on a non-refrigerated shelf, I was stumped. The ingredients said &#8220;milk,&#8221; and there was even an allergy<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/strawberry-milk02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254" title="strawberry-milk02" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/strawberry-milk02.jpg?w=211&#038;h=300" alt="" width="211" height="300" /></a> warning, so it had to be real. Even now, after further research into the ingredients list, I&#8217;m still stumped. <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/40858-sodium-phosphate-label/">Sodium phosphate</a> is an emulsifier, <a href="http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question315.htm">carrageenan</a> is another emulsifier, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinyl_palmitate">Vitamin A palmitate</a> is a vitamin and <a href="http://www.vrp.com/bone-and-joint/vitamin-d3-higher-doses-reduce-risk-of-common-health-concerns">Vitamin D3</a> is &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; another vitamin. Nothing special here, unless I&#8217;m missing something and one of these is a preservative.</p>
<p>The container, though, did say &#8220;ultra-pasteruized.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure I want to know what goes into that process, but I guess it made me feel a little better.</p>
<p>At any rate, when faced with the choice of buying regular milk or strawberry milk, I opted for the strawberry, purely for the containers&#8217; disgusting Pepto-Bismol hue.</p>
<p>And when I got home, I refrigerated it for a solid two hours. I didn&#8217;t care that it had been sitting on the shelf at room-temperature this whole time (or well actually, I did care a little) &#8230; I knew lukewarm strawberry milk would be automatically nasty.</p>
<p>When I finally pulled one out to drink it and poked the little straw through the aluminum-covered hole, I felt a sense of nostalgia that was immediately replaced by the reminder that I was about to drink something I was probably going to hate.</p>
<p>I took a sip.</p>
<p><em>Sweet</em>. Very, very, very sweet.</p>
<p>But other than that, not actually that terrible.</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/strawberry-milk03.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-255" title="strawberry-milk03" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/strawberry-milk03.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>I drank some more &#8212; slowly, because it really was a sugar overload. This stuff was definitely more <em>strawberry</em> than <em>milk</em> &#8230; and really just more sugar than strawberry, since the strawberry flavor hardly tasted like fruit.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t have surprised me: The second ingredient, after milk, was sugar. And with 20 grams of it in that little 6-ounce container, the stuff was loaded.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not entirely convinced it was milk, even though the carton promised it was. (Announced it, actually, in a speech bubble on the front emitting from a crazy-eyed emoticon &#8212; which brings me back to the trendy-but-not point.)</p>
<p>Much as I love (and sometimes hate) boxes full of drinkable things, I can&#8217;t see myself sipping on this stuff anytime soon. But if you&#8217;re looking for a cheap, portable, low-spillage-risk variation of milk for kids, this could work. Just be warned: despite all the vitamins in it (a whopping two), it&#8217;s also chock-full of sugar &#8212; and that&#8217;s apparent from the very first sip.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Low fat milk, sugar, natural flavors, sodium phosphate, carrageenan, Red 40, Vitamin A palmate and Vitamin D3.<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Price: </strong>$2.50 at Fry&#8217;s Marketplace (four per package)<br />
<strong>Pros:</strong> It does have vitamins and calcium in it, and it comes in nice little boxes with straws. Oh, and apparently you don&#8217;t need to refrigerate it, somehow.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Sugar. Lots and lots and lots of it.

					<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/beet-cookies01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-246" title="Polaroid  A700 picture" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/beet-cookies01.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>Even though I&#8217;m not a fan of raisins (I call them grape corpses, if that&#8217;s any indication of my feelings toward them), they&#8217;re normal in cookies.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And red cookies are even normal, especially around this time of year. My mom made some red-dyed chocolate chip cookies just the other day. Red is festive.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">But beets?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Beets are not normal in cookies.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;m blogging from the not-so-far-away state of Oklahoma, where I&#8217;ve been staying with a friend for the past several days. I asked her where I could find unconventional grocery food around here, and she drove me to a place called <a href="http://www.akins.com/retailer/store_templates/shell_id_1.asp?storeID=A59A6B1C10E44C9E9420A7A75B27460A">Akin&#8217;s Natural Foods</a>.</p>
<p>Akin&#8217;s carries food that&#8217;s organic, gluten-free, sugar-free &#8230; basically any variation of &#8220;healthful&#8221; you can think of. But &#8220;healthful&#8221; does not always equal &#8220;yummy.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I came across these <a href="http://www.annnutandfruitcake.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ANFCBRR1LB">beet root and raisin cookies</a>, I nearly passed them up purely by instinct. Beets + grape corpses = cookies? I don&#8217;t think so. I may be a journalist, but that&#8217;s simple math right there.</p>
<p>But their they were, in all their red, festive glory. &#8220;Taste the Dream,&#8221; the front of the package read. I wondered if <em>dream</em> was a nice way of saying <em>nightmare</em>.</p>
<p>I flipped the package over. It had a nice little blurb on the back:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Cookies inspired by a loving mom with a devotion to teach the art of baking. We start with fresh beet root from the garden. Each cookie is individually sealed for your enjoyment. You can serve these cookies anytime and people will be delighted. Our cookies are baked in a dedicated bakery and are cookies you can trust.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Even after this assurance, I didn&#8217;t feel especially trusting toward these cookies &#8212; not with their bright red hue and beet pulp running through them like veins.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All of this made them a prime candidate, of course.<a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/beet-cookies02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-247" title="Polaroid  A700 picture" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/beet-cookies02.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When I got them home (figuratively speaking, since I&#8217;m still in Oklahoma), I opened up the package and all but stuck my face inside, prepared to take a big whiff. I smelled nothing &#8230; and then I remembered the &#8220;individually wrapped&#8221; part. Of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So I pulled out a neatly-cellophaned cookie and delicately unwrapped it. It almost felt like Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It almost smelled like Christmas, too. It was like a gingerbread cookie, warmly spicy &#8230; but with a pungent vegetable scent mixed in. If I could push past the beet flavor, I thought, maybe it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. I took a bite.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It did not taste like Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In fact, it was absolutely horrifying. I kept chewing slowly, torturously, hoping to be able to muscle past that beet taste (and my gag reflex) and arrive at that sweet, cinnamon flavor I&#8217;d smelled vaguely. But no such luck. All I could taste was beet. No sugar, no spices &#8230; nothing. Even the grape corpses were undetectable.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the end, this is as far as I got:</p>
<p><a href="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/beet-cookies03.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-248 aligncenter" title="Polaroid  A700 picture" src="http://probablyedible.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/beet-cookies03.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t handle any more.</p>
<p>The upside to these cookies is that they&#8217;re chock-full of healthful ingredients, from beetroot (obviously) to wheat flower and all-natural, gluten-free molasses. (The molasses &#8212; mixed with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves &#8212; was apparently what gave it the gingerbread-cookie smell.)</p>
<p>The downside is that you can&#8217;t taste any of the ingredients except beets.</p>
<p>(Oh, but according to the website, the packaging is biodegradable. Maybe it&#8217;s edible. It probably tastes better than the cookies.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: If you are absolutely in love with beets, then you&#8217;ll probably like these. And since you&#8217;re probably the only person in your general vicinity with said beet-love, you&#8217;ll probably get the entire $6 bag to yourself.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re looking for cookies that actually possess some resemblance to cookies in terms of taste &#8230; these are not what you&#8217;re looking for. Stay far, far away.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Beetroot (raw), wheat flour (white all-purpose, enriched and unbleached), butter (salted), organic cane sugar (granulated dried cane juice sugar), nonfat dry milk (with added Vitamin A), raisins (gourmet plump seedless), baking powder (aluminum-free), soy lecithin granules (all natural soybean lecithin granules made with no fillers or additives), water, pure vanilla extract, salt, nutmeg (ground), cinnamon (ground), baking soda (aluminum-free), molasses (all-natural, unsulfered and gluten-free) and cloves (ground).<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Price: </strong>$6.99 at Akin&#8217;s (8 cookies per bag)<br />
<strong>Pros:</strong> Individually wrapped, so you can give them as Christmas presents to each neighbor you can&#8217;t stand. Also, might make great horse treats.<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Beet <del>cookies</del>.
