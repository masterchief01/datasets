<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: This inspiration for this meal was a lovely bottle of <a href="http://www.starlanevineyard.com/db_product/75" target="_blank">Dierberg Chardonnay</a>. Brandon and I have our favorites when it comes to wine varietals &#8211; I would probably list a super dry and earthy cabernet franc as my top choice, and I think he would list a really good, spicy pinot noir &#8211; but we&#8217;ve both been in love with oaked chardonnay lately, too. That buttery oak flavor just hasn&#8217;t been topped for us when it comes to whites. And a good bottle of wine always deserves a good meal, right?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What We Loved</span>: This was the best fancy meal that we&#8217;ve made in a really long time. There are so many wonderful aspects to this dish that I don&#8217;t even know where to start. So I&#8217;ll begin with the tenderness of the chicken, which is what immediately jumped out at us as being remarkable. I really couldn&#8217;t even believe how moist and tender the final result was &#8211; I never knew that a chicken breast (which is really the toughest part of the bird) could be so ridiculously tender. It was fabulous! Add to that the earthy, herbal mushroom flavor of the filling and the rich, salty pan sauce with a nice white wine flavor, and this meal was just perfect. It truly felt like something that you might order at a restaurant. We paired this with some creamy lima beans mixed with butter, salt, and pepper and our gorgeous bottle of chardonnay for a perfect Saturday night supper.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tips</span>: I think this is the first time that I&#8217;ve had stuffed and rolled chicken breasts turn out properly shape-wise &#8211; that is, in a nice, neat spiral. I&#8217;ve tried many times, and do you know what the problem usually is? I hurry through it. As I&#8217;ve found in most things that are cooking-related, if you take your time, the results are really just so much better. So I would suggest being really patient with pounding the chicken nice and flat, spreading the mushroom mixture neatly and flatly, and rolling up the chicken carefully (even undoing and re-rolling if you need to). It&#8217;s worth the extra time for such a pretty result.</p>
<p><strong>French-Style Stuffed Chicken Breasts</strong><br />
<em>Source: Adapted from <a href="http://annies-eats.net/2010/12/16/french-style-stuffed-chicken-breasts/" target="_blank">Annie&#8217;s Eats</a>, originally from Cooks Illustrated</em></p>
<p>I cut the original recipe in half to serve two and made some further modifications. Here&#8217;s the recipe as I made it.</p>
<p>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (with tenderloins attached)<br />
Butter<br />
4 oz. baby bella mushrooms, sliced<br />
1/2 small leek, chopped<br />
1 clove garlic, minced<br />
1/4 &#8211; 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br />
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, divided<br />
1/3 cup dry white wine (I used a chardonnay)<br />
Kosher salt and black pepper<br />
1/2 cup chicken stock<br />
1/2 teaspoon brown mustard<br />
<em></em></p>
<p>1. Remove the tenderloins from the chicken breasts and roughly chop. Place into a food processor, and process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl.</p>
<p>2. Butterfly each chicken breast horizontally, leaving the two halves attached. Open the butterflied breasts, and lay them flat. Place the chicken into a large ziplock bag, squeeze out the air, and seal. Pound the chicken to 1/4 inch thickness.</p>
<p>3. Heat some butter in a saute pan. Add the mushrooms, and cook until the moisture evaporates and the mushrooms brown. Add the leek and more butter, if necessary, and cook for a few more minutes. Add the garlic and thyme, and cook for about a minute. Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice and stir.</p>
<p>4. Transfer the mushroom mixture to the food processor. Return the pan to the heat, add the wine, and scrape the pan to loosen the browned bits. Transfer the wine mixture to a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p>5. Pulse the mushroom mixture in the food processor until finely chopped. Add to the bowl with the pureed chicken. Season with salt and pepper, and mix well.</p>
<p>6. Spread half of the filling into each chicken breast, smoothing if flat and leaving an edge around the perimeter. Roll up each breast as tightly as possible, and place seam side down. Tie with kitchen twine if desired.</p>
<p>7. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat some more butter in the saute pan, carefully add the chicken seam-side down, and brown. Flip, brown the other side, and then flip one more time so that the seam-side is down again. Add the chicken stock and the reserved wine mixture, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and tent with foil.</p>
<p>8. Whisk the mustard into the cooking liquid in the pan. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan to incorporate them into the sauce. Simmer until reduced and thickened, about 8-10 minutes. Turn off the heat, and whisk in the butter and 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>9. Slice the chicken, and serve it with the sauce spooned over top.</p>

						<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7023" title="Michigan Burgers with Goat Cheese and Cherry Salsa" src="http://ourlifeinfood.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/burgers-with-goat-cheese-and-cherry-salsa-2.jpg?w=614&#038;h=409" alt="" width="614" height="409" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: One of my favorite things about living in Michigan is the fresh, local cherries, which are probably the top food item that Michigan is known for. They&#8217;re gorgeous and they&#8217;re everywhere at this time of year, and I can never get enough. I kind of get all sentimental just thinking about it &#8211; I love living here and love everything that the local farmers, chefs, brewers, etc. provide us. And I find it really awesome that no matter where you live, there are always going to be those local items, personalities, restaurants, etc. that are just really unique to the area. I love that.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What We Loved</span>: For those who like sweet and savory combinations, this recipe is perfect. The cherry salsa is actually just very mildly sweet, so it lends a subtle fruit flavor to the dish and just a touch of spice from the minced jalapenos. Goat cheese is always fabulous in my book, but I particularly love it in applications where it melts, like atop burgers. The texture gets so creamy and fabulous. And of course, a hamburger grilled on a charcoal grill has a wonderful charred and smoky flavor that just can&#8217;t be matched. A bite of smoky burger with some creamy cheese and a bit of rich, fruity salsa &#8211; well, that&#8217;s just perfect.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tips</span>: As you can see in the picture, I like to pick out the deepest, darkest, ripest looking cherries &#8211; in my opinion, they&#8217;re the best! The cherries that are redder or brighter in color look prettier but they aren&#8217;t quite as ripe and are usually harder/have less flavor. The deep, richly colored ones are nice and soft and are bursting with juice and flavor. They turn your fingertips purple and are just magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>Burgers with Goat Cheese and Cherry Salsa</strong><br />
<em>Source: Cherry Salsa from <a href="http://livingtastefully.weebly.com/2/post/2010/07/fresh-cherry-salsa-my-new-easy-favorite.html" target="_blank">Living Tastefully</a></em></p>
<p>I made enough cherry salsa for two burgers. See the link above for a full recipe.</p>
<p>10-15 sweet cherries, pits removed and diced<br />
1/2 tablespoon or so minced jalapeno (seeded first)<br />
Few leaves fresh basil, minced<br />
Dash balsamic vinegar<br />
Kosher salt and black pepper<br />
3/4 lb ground beef, shaped into two burgers<br />
2-3 oz fresh goat cheese, cut into thick slices<br />
Garlic powder<br />
Seasoning salt</p>
<p>1. Combine the cherries, jalapeno, basil, and vinegar in a bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>
<p>2. Season the burgers with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Cook/grill as desired.</p>
<p>3. Top the burgers with the goat cheese and cherry salsa.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: I can be very lazy with dinner sometimes, usually on a Friday night. It&#8217;s been a long week at that point, and like everyone else, I&#8217;m tired. A lot of times we&#8217;ll go grab a beer at a pub after work or stop in somewhere for a glass of wine, and after that, it&#8217;s all over. Long week + beer/wine = lazy. So what the heck do we do for dinner on those kinds of nights? <a href="http://bunnyeatsdesign.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/sexy-french-sausages-take-2/" target="_blank">Yes!</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What we Loved</span>: This is just a fun meal all around. Being able to sample so many different items is really a treat. There&#8217;s such a variance in flavors &#8211; spicy sausage, creamy cheese and avocado, crisp lettuce, sweet tomatoes, rich baked beans, a little of this and a little of that. We loved mixing and matching the different flavors. This is a good Friday or Saturday night dinner that&#8217;s fun and delicious, and it&#8217;s already one of our favorites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tips</span>: The possibilities are endless with a meal like this. We&#8217;ve actually had this meal three times before it even made it onto the blog, and the other couple of times I switched out some of the ingredients for some sauteed poblano peppers and onions, a dollop of sour cream, and sliced green chiles. And if I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten lazy last time, I would have added a nice sunny-side up egg as well. I also think that pico de gallo, pickled red onions, guacamole, roasted sweet potatoes, or crumbled Mexican chorizo are some great options. So yes, there are a million roads to take with this fun dinner. In fact, I&#8217;m going to have to use some of those options to make a completely different Mexican/Southwest-style plate. I&#8217;m also excited to use this idea to try different variations of all of our favorite cuisines, with Mediterranean being next (homemade hummus, cucumber slices, black olives, chunks of feta cheese, maybe some white beans with oregano&#8230;.).</p>
<p><strong>Mexican/Southwest-Style Sampler Plate</strong><br />
<em>Source: Inspired by <a href="http://bunnyeatsdesign.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/sexy-french-sausages-take-2/" target="_blank">Bunny.Eats.Design.</a></em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: Sundays were just made for dinners like these, right? A meal that&#8217;s a little more involved, something fancy or some good comfort food, a nice bottle of wine. What a perfect way to wind down from the weekend and start the week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What We Loved</span>: There were a few aspects of this dish that we really enjoyed &#8211; the charcoal/grilled flavor that was absorbed into the meat, the seasoned crust, and the taste of the lamb itself. When we each took our first bites, we were somewhat surprised by how much of the charcoal flavor that the lamb picked up. It was extremely noticeable and fabulous. And as lamb has a somewhat earthy flavor on its own, earthy rosemary is always a super pairing. This recipe combines rosemary with plenty of garlic to add a nice depth of flavor and seasoning to the lamb, and the meat itself is rich and tender. I roasted some zucchini, yellow squash, and onions and served them alongside this lamb with a side of tzatziki sauce for an all-around great meal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tips</span>: We grilled this directly over the coals for the entire duration without flipping, which resulted in a charred crust on the bottom. In spots it was a little <em>too </em>charred, so we might suggest flipping the meat a time or two to create more even browning. The reason that we didn&#8217;t flip the meat was because we had a meat thermometer inserted into the middle and sticking out of the top, and I didn&#8217;t want to mess with moving it around after we started cooking. Sticking the thermometer into the end or side of the meat would be a nice way to solve that problem and allow you to flip the meat as needed. Also &#8211; we had a  small cut of meat (2.25 lbs), so the cooking time was relatively short &#8211; about an hour. If you use a large cut, grilling over indirect heat would probably be necessary.</p>

<em>Source: Adapted from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/rosemary-and-garlic-roast-leg-of-lamb-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Emeril Lagasse</a></em></p>
<p>1 leg of lamb, bone in (ours was about 2.25 lbs)<br />
Juice from 1/2 small lemon<br />
Extra virgin olive oil<br />
1-2 cloves garlic, minced<br />
1-2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary<br />
Kosher salt and black pepper</p>
<p>1. Remove the lamb from the fridge and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Drizzle with olive oil and the lemon juice, using your hands to rub the liquids into the meat.</p>
<p>2. Using your hands, pat the rosemary and garlic all over the outside of the lamb. Sprinkle with Kosher salt and black pepper.</p>
<p>3. Insert a meat thermometer into the end of the lamb, inserting it into the middle and away from the bone. Grill on a charcoal grill until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees for rare, about an hour. Flip while cooking to ensure even browning.</p>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: Ahhhhh beer. I think it&#8217;s safe to say that it&#8217;s our number one obsession right now. We have a <em>lot</em> of favorites, but Belgian beers are a style that both of us would list at the very top. Over the past few years we&#8217;ve done a lot of&#8230;..research?&#8230;..and have fallen in love with both the very characteristic and unique flavor of true Belgian beers as well as the great interpretations in the American craft brew scene. So how could I pass by a recipe like this?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What we Loved</span>: For a couple of beer lovers like us, these were wonderful. The fantastically rich beer flavor absorbed itself into everything in the dish, resulting in a rich ale taste with just a slight touch of bitterness (not bad bitter, but bitterness like you&#8217;d find in a something like a pale ale). We used some pretty complex beers, which I&#8217;m sure impacted the flavor of the final dish pretty directly. And for us, it was great! I was also so pleased with the texture/sauce of the final dish, which was thick and creamy just like a great baked bean recipe should be. And of course, the big pieces of bacon added some nice texture and that fabulous bacon flavor.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Helpful Hints</span>: I let these beans cook in a crock pot since I had to work all day, but the original recipe called for them to be baked in the oven for 2-3 hours. The crock pot worked just fine, though there was still quite a lot of liquid left at the end of cooking. I just transferred my stove top-safe insert to the stove (so convenient!) and boiled the beans until they were nice and thick (about 20 minutes). If you don&#8217;t have a stove top-safe insert and transferring to the stove is too much work, you could also try turning your crock pot to high, but I would probably recommend just cooking as originally instructed at <em>The Bitten Word. </em>Also &#8211; I used a couple of Belgian style American craft beers that we had around the house (Dark Horse Sapient Trip Ale and Troeg&#8217;s DreamWeaver Wheat, if you&#8217;re interested). We loved the resulting beer flavor, but if you&#8217;re not a <em>huge</em> beer fan like we are, I would recommend sticking with something lighter like Blue Moon for a more subtle beer flavor.</p>

<p><strong>White Beans with Belgian Style Beer<br />
</strong> <strong></strong><em>Source: Adapted from <a href="http://www.thebittenword.com/thebittenword/2011/05/beer-baked-white-beans-.html" target="_blank">The Bitten Word</a>, originally from Everyday Food</em></p>
<p>I made these in a crock pot with a stove top-safe insert, so that&#8217;s what I will give instructions for.</p>
<p>10 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces<br />
1 medium Vidalia onion, diced small<br />
4 garlic cloves, minced<br />
1 tablespoon mustard<br />
Dried thyme and oregano<br />
1 pound dried white beans, picked over, soaked overnight, and drained<br />
2 12 oz bottles Belgian style ale<br />
1 3/4 cups chicken stock<br />
Kosher salt and ground black pepper<br />
1 to 2 tablespoons cider vinegar</p>
<p>1. Saute the bacon in a your stove top-safe insert until crisp and browned. Remove the bacon and reserve. Drain most of the extraneous fat.</p>
<p>2. Add the onions to the insert, and cook until softened and beginning to brown. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more.</p>
<p>3. Add the mustard, a good sprinkle of thyme and oregano, beans, beer, and stock. Season well with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>4. Place the insert in the crock pot, and cook on low for 8 hours. If there is too much liquid at this point, transfer the insert to the stove top and bring to a boil until the mixture reduces and thickens.</p>
<p>5. Return the reserved bacon to the insert. Season to taste with additional salt, pepper, and 1-2 tablespoons of cider vinegar.</p>
<p>6. Serve as desired. I served ours atop chopped romaine hearts with crumbled goat cheese.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: This recipe was one of my first blog posts back in September of 2008. Since then, I can easily say that I&#8217;ve served this more than any other single recipe in the last couple of years. As you can see from all of the photos, it&#8217;s our favorite standby side dish that we return to again and again. I think that makes it deserving of an updated post.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Zucchini Almond Saute" src="http://ourlifeinfood.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/zucchini-almond-saute-6.jpg?w=614&#038;h=409" alt="" width="614" height="409" /></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What we Loved</span>: This dish is a <em>snap </em>to throw together, and we both just love everything about the bright and simple flavors. It&#8217;s a quick one pan saute of olive oil, fresh zucchini, nutty almonds, and plenty of salt and black pepper, topped with rich Parmesan cheese. That&#8217;s it! The ingredients marry so well and leave you with a  bright and fresh vegetable side dish that goes so well with any number of main dishes. I make it nearly every time that I serve chicken piccata (maybe the only meal that I rarely vary?), and I&#8217;ve served it with countless other main dishes, too &#8211; sauteed white fish (which is one of my favorite combinations, especially in summer, as it makes for a really light and refreshing meal), Chicken Parmesan (it goes great with any Italian, tomato sauce-based meal), stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes - basically whenever I need a great vegetable to serve alongside my main dish. And really, I could eat a big bowl just on its own for lunch or a light dinner, too.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Helpful Hints</span>: I always bring the salt to the table, because I like a good bit of salt sprinkled on top. I&#8217;m definitely one who loves her salt, but I really do feel that the extra salt sprinkled on top adds a lot of flavor. I&#8217;ve also tried shredding my Parmesan for this meal instead of shaving it, but it&#8217;s not nearly as good, in my opinion. Those big shavings of Parmesan are just really tasty. And thirdly, I like to use the thinnest zucchinis that I can find. These are generally firmer and have less seeds, and they lend themselves well to bright and crisp zucchini pieces in the final dish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Zucchini Almond Saute" src="http://ourlifeinfood.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/zu1.jpg?w=614&#038;h=409" alt="" width="614" height="409" /></p>
<p><strong>Zucchini Almond Saute</strong><br />

<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe that I always make for Brandon and me. It makes a whole pan, but then we eat a <em>lot</em> of vegetables with dinner. You may want to use less zucchini if you&#8217;re looking for smaller portions.</p>
<p>2-3 thin zucchini, sliced into matchsticks<br />
A handful of almonds, roughly chopped (about 1/4 cup)<br />
Parmesan cheese, shaved into thin slices<br />
Kosher salt and black pepper<br />
Extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p>1. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan. When hot, add the zucchini and almonds to the pan, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute until the zucchini starts to soften, only a few minutes.</p>
<p>2. Plate the zucchini and almond mixture and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese shavings.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: We&#8217;ve certainly been eating a lot of summery salads lately. I sure do love winter comfort foods, but with the first signs of sunshine in the spring, I&#8217;m always more than ready to give them the boot. Light, casual food is one of our favorite things about summer, though there sure are a lot of things to love. Walks in the park, weekends downtown in the sunshine, cocktails, vacations, flip-flops, BBQs. I hope that everyone who celebrates Memorial Day this weekend gets a good dose of all of the summer things that make them happy!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What We Loved</span>: Brandon just couldn&#8217;t get enough of this meal. He&#8217;s been really into the entrée type salads lately &#8211; those with a nice bed of lettuce, plenty of protein, and some great veggies. Like the <a href="http://ourlifeinfood.com/2011/05/04/mexican-shredded-beef-salad-with-goat-cheese-and-grape-tomatoes/" target="_blank">shredded beef salad</a> we had a few weeks ago, this salad is so full of flavors that it doesn&#8217;t even need a dressing. The chicken is mixed with three kinds of cheeses &#8211; cream cheese, cheddar, and Monterey Jack &#8211; and there are all kinds of Mexican spices and seasonings thrown in. The result is a rich, cheesy, spicy chicken mixture that is warm and wonderful. Combined with fresh and crisp romaine hearts, creamy avocado, and sweet tomatoes, this salad is just packed full of protein, vegetables, and flavor &#8211; which is really all that you need.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Helpful Hints</span>: Though we loved this salad exactly as it was, anything that you would normally throw into a Mexican meal would probably be a good addition &#8211; sour cream, black olives, additional salsa, minced onions, pickled jalapenos, etc.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: I&#8217;ve mentioned before that Brandon went to Brazil a few years back and that he introduced me to some new foods when he came back. Hearts of palm are one of those foods that he first tried at a Brazilian BBQ. For Brandon, they&#8217;ll always remind him of that meal, and for me, they will forever be linked to the romantic images of Brazil that live in my head. 85 degrees with glorious sunshine every day, perfect meals on the beach every night, drinking pina coladas in bathing suits all day long. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like, right? And because Brandon also introduced me to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha" target="_blank">caipirinha</a> after returning from Brazil, in my eyes it&#8217;s practically a crime not to serve up a delicious caipirinha when you&#8217;re eating hearts of palm. They make a perfect pairing!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What We Loved</span>: This salad is summer in a bowl. If you haven&#8217;t had hearts of palm before, they&#8217;re very tart and tangy, with a surprising creamy texture. Looking at them, you&#8217;d think that they might be crunchy or maybe have that vegetable crispness of something like a cucumber, but they&#8217;re actually very soft and creamy. Combined with their extremely tangy flavor, they&#8217;re really a unique food that is unlike anything else that I&#8217;ve had. And I think that this salad works so well because the other ingredients have similar components. There&#8217;s more tang from the lime, and the avocado chunks add some extra creaminess. With a hit of salt, some fresh cilantro, and a nice drizzle of rich olive oil, this salad is so bright/fresh and rich/indulgent all at the same time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Helpful Hints</span>: We enjoyed this salad alongside <a href="http://ourlifeinfood.com/2011/05/20/whitefish-with-banana-salsa/" target="_blank">whitefish with banana salsa</a> &#8211; a really great pairing!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: I was browsing through <a href="http://www.thesweetslife.com/" target="_blank">Natalie&#8217;s</a> blog when I ran across <a href="http://www.thesweetslife.com/2010/09/tilapia-with-black-bean-salsa.html" target="_blank">this</a> recipe. Bananas are one of my favorite treats, but the thought had never once crossed my mind to try cooking with them. Is it just me, or is that idea incredibly different/odd/intriguing? I didn&#8217;t even have the patience to wait for a sunny summer day to throw this on the grill and eat outside with a nice cocktail, as I had originally planned. Next time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What We Loved</span>: The salsa in this meal is truly fantastic. It&#8217;s very mild, light, and fresh, with a creamy and sweet banana flavor. The jalapeños add a lovely kick of spice, and I always enjoy the fresh, clean herbal flavor of cilantro. All in all, the ingredients combine beautifully for a gorgeous, well-rounded topping for this fish. We served this with a hearts of palm salad (recipe to be posted soon) for a great meal that was just chock-full of tropical flavors. I can see this salsa being good in so many applications, including on its own as a salad or side dish.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Helpful Hints</span>: The original recipe calls for the fish to be seasoned with chili powder, salt, and pepper. I chose to mix these seasonings in with coconut flour. It seemed like a good idea &#8211; doesn&#8217;t coconut sound great with the rest of these flavors? &#8211; but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend doing it that way. I had a terrible time getting the crust to crisp up (read &#8211; it didn&#8217;t at all), and the coconut flour didn&#8217;t do much in the way of actually sticking to the fish. So I would recommend either following the original recipe (saute the fish with the seasonings in a pan) or throwing the fish on the grill for a nice crispy, grilled crust. Also, Brandon loved this meal but remarked that he thought that the delicate flavors of the fish were just a touch overpowered by the salsa. If you&#8217;re worried about that, maybe use a little less salsa than I did. Or, I think that a thicker chicken breast would be also be a good match for this recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Whitefish with Banana Salsa</strong><br />
<em>Source: Adapted (slightly) from <a href="http://www.thesweetslife.com/2010/09/tilapia-with-black-bean-salsa.html" target="_blank">The Sweets Life</a>, originally from Clean Eating Magazine</em></p>
<p>2 whitefish filets (tilapia, flounder, sole, etc.)<br />
Chili powder<br />
1/2 can black beans, drained and rinsed<br />
1 banana, chopped<br />
Handful fresh cilantro, minced<br />
1 slice Vidalia onion, finely diced<br />
1/2 jalapeño, minced<br />
Kosher salt and black pepper</p>
<p>1. Mix together the black beans, banana, cilantro, onion, and jalapeño. Season to taste with Kosher salt and black pepper.</p>
<p>2. Sprinkle the fish with chili powder and Kosher salt, and cook as desired (next time, I think we&#8217;ll grill it until it has a nice, slightly blackened crust. The original recipe calls for cooking in a saute pan for 3-4 minutes per side).</p>
<p>3. Serve the fish topped with the salsa.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration</span>: When we stay in on a Friday or a Saturday night, we always like to make our dinner a fun meal, and crab legs are one of our favorite meals for those occasions. Recently we spread the coffee table with a big pile of crab legs, dishes of butter, piles of napkins, and a big bowl for shells. We popped in <em>Dexter</em> and spent a couple of hours watching one of our favorite shows and eating one of our favorite foods. Blissful. And though a big plate of crab legs can make a meal of their own, I usually like to serve a little something extra, and I always make it something that you can eat with your hands. It&#8217;s far too much of a pain and a messy hassle to bother with a fork while you&#8217;re eating crab legs!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What We Loved</span>: I&#8217;ve actually made these little bites several times, and they&#8217;re one of our favorite little appetizers. All of the flavors of caprese (the absolute definition of spring and summer and everything sunshine to me) in a handy little snack. Fresh tomatoes, bright basil, and creamy mozzarella, all topped with rich olive oil, balsamic, and salt and pepper. What a perfect and fresh little snack.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Helpful Hints</span>: I used relatively big cherry tomatoes this time around, and they were a little too big to eat quite as easily. I would recommend using smaller grape tomatoes.</p>
