<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/02/gratitude-with-a-cherry-tomato-on-top/" title="baked tomato sauce"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/166/397250947_879fc518db.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="baked tomato sauce" /></a> </p>
Last week, the stunningly redesigned <a href="http://www.deliciousdays.com">Delicious Days</a> &#8212; seriously, looking at that site brings rolling fields awash in sunlight to mind &#8212; <a href="http://www.deliciousdays.com/archives/2007/02/10/someone-has-nibbled-at-my-bread-web-bites">paid homage to food blogs</a> and the way they quickly became her favorite place to get recipes; they&#8217;re tested, photographed and honestly discussed. I couldn&#8217;t agree more, except unlike Delicious Days, I sometimes bookmark recipes others have referenced but then completely forget who first whispered the url in my ear. This is a both wonderful and terrible thing, wonderful because Monday night, I made one of the best tomato sauces I&#8217;ve ever eaten, but terrible because I can&#8217;t remember who to thank. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/397250496/" title="tomatoes, ready to roast"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/397250496_80a5a170b0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="tomatoes, ready to roast" /></a> </p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you&#8217;re into that whole, oh, you know, blistered tomato, garlic/olive oil/sharp cheese type of thing, you simply must try this. The best part, if you ask me, is that you can even make it with those cherry or large grape tomatoes that stay eerily fantastic &#8212; I try not to question it &#8212; through the winter. Halve them and roast them cut side up in an olive oil slicked baking dish and top them with a mix of bread crumbs, garlic, parmesan and romano cheeses for all of twenty minutes, and ta-da, deliciousness is yours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/397250601/" title="cacades"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/397250601_8166ec69cf.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="cacades" /></a> </p>
<p><span id="more-196"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to insist that you use fresh bread crumbs here &#8212; that sawdust from a can probably won&#8217;t cut it. But fortunately, that&#8217;s as easy as grabbing a single cheapo bakery roll from your grocery store, slicing it into discs, drying it in the oven for 10 minutes or so (hey, you&#8217;re preheating the oven anyhow) and pulsing it in the food processor. Even the flavor of the most generic roll is miles ahead of the stale, pre-packaged alternative. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/397250785/" title="locks"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/156/397250785_eb5d61224d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="locks" /></a> </p>
<p>And that&#8217;s all there is. I mean, sure, you can crank out a batch of fettuccine while your tomatoes are roasting, matching fresh ingredients to even fresher ones, but you could also boil a pot of fusilli, like the recipe suggests. Either way, this is the best quick pastas I&#8217;ve had in eons, something I am sure will quickly become a staple, so thank you, whomever you are. Meals like this alone make my countless weekly hours of blog-gazing worthwhile.</p>

<p><b>Pasta with Baked Tomato Sauce</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/104465">The Best American Recipes 2000 via Epicurious.com</a></p>
<p>Oddly, the original recipe calls for 1/3 cup olive oil, but never tells you what to do with more than a couple tablespoons of that. I found three to four tablespoons to be just right. </p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<p>3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br />
1 pound very ripe cherry tomatoes, halved<br />
1/3 cup plain dry bread crumbs<br />
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese<br />
2 tablespoons freshly grated pecorino cheese<br />
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br />
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br />
1 pound dried fusilli (corkscrew) or farfalline (butterfly) pasta<br />
1/4 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves, torn</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 400&#176;F. Grease a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the oil.</p>
<p>Place the tomatoes cut side up in the dish.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheeses, and garlic and toss with a fork to mix well. Sprinkle the bread-crumb mixture over the tomatoes, making sure that each cut side is well covered with the crumb mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and then the final tablespoon of olive oil. Bake until the tomatoes are cooked through and starting to brown on top, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Time the pasta so it finishes cooking about the time the tomatoes are ready to come out of the oven.</p>
<p><b>The Pasta Recipe I&#8217;ve Been Coming Back To, Again and Again</b><br />
Adapted from Gourmet Magazine</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br />
2 large eggs<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
3 tablespoons water </p>
<p><u>To make pasta dough in a food processor:</u> Blend flour, eggs, salt, and water in processor until mixture just begins to form a ball, adding more water, drop by drop, if dough is too dry (dough should be firm and not sticky). Process dough for 15 seconds more to knead it. Transfer to a floured surface and let stand, covered with an inverted bowl, 1 hour to let the gluten relax and make rolling easier. (Note: I skimped on the one hour waiting this time, and it still worked out just fine.)</p>
<p><u>To make dough by hand: </u> Mound flour on a work surface, preferably wooden, and make a well in center. Add eggs, salt, and water to well. With a fork, gently beat eggs and water until combined. Gradually stir in enough flour to form a paste, pulling in flour closest to egg mixture and being careful not to make an opening in outer wall of well. Knead remaining flour into mixture with your hands to form a dough, adding more water, drop by drop, if dough is too dry (dough should be firm and not sticky). Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Cover with an inverted bowl and let stand 1 hour (to make rolling easier).</p>

				<p>Very interesting idea, I had never thought of roasting tomatoes with breadcrumbs (or using cheese while roasting to create a &#8220;sauce&#8221;). I bet it would also be amazing to start with some home-made confit tomatoes instead of fresh ones mmmm the possibilities :)<br />
Simple is better in many cases, and this is definitely one of them.</p>
<p>And I have to agree with you on blogs, they just give you a better insight into recipes, and a closer look. If only all of our blogs were as beautiful as Delicious Days!</p>

				<p>Alternatively, on the breadcrumbs idea, try panko.  A little lighter, a little airy-er and delicious!</p>

				<p>That looks simply delicious! Tomatoes, garlic, cheese, perfect! I&#8217;ll have to settle for dried pasta though as a pasta machine is still on my &#8220;wish&#8221; list! I&#8217;ll have to add that baking dish of yours on my list as well&#8230;</p>

				<p>Yum!  Will definitely try this.  I&#8217;ve started copy and pasting recipes I find on the web into emails I send myself.  I use gmail&#8217;s tag function, tag &#8216;em as recipes, and then I have my internet cookbook anywhere there&#8217;s a computer!  Very helpful.</p>

				<p>Oh no!  Of course you would recommend something as amazing-looking and right up my alley as this recipe on the first day of Lent when I have given up white carbs!  It&#8217;s going to be a long 40 days, but now I know what I&#8217;ll be serving with my Easter ham this year!!</p>

				<p>Uhhh&#8230;may I have a rag for my drool??  I love roasting tomatoes but I have yet to attempt doing so with the little ones.  It looks simple and delish.  Since I am going to be alone next week, I might have to make this dish. Now, how can I convince B to get my the Kitchen Aid food processor I want???</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s amazing what stale bread can do for a dish, isn&#8217;t it? I too love food blogs, particularly for tested recipes like this that can be added to the week day repertoire. Looks fabulous!</p>

				<p>Sounds delicious!  I&#8217;ll be sure to try this recipe.  And no need to thank me for this suggestion, which I must insist that you try: <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/109105" rel="nofollow">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/109105</a> &#8212; Castellane with Mascarpone and Roasted Grape Tomatoes.  (Never made it with castellane, but I can vouch for it being delicious with all kinds of pasta! and I always use less mascarpone than they call for&#8230;but only so I can eat a lot without feeling too terribly guilty :)&#8230;)</p>

				<p>Oh this is perfect!  I have some grape tomatoes almost ready to go in the bin.  Now I have a way to use them!  Too bad I just had pasta last night (corkscrews, natch).  Yum yum yum&#8230; so basically after done roasting, just toss with the pasta?  Mmm!</p>

				<p>I can vouch for the deliciousness of this as I am digging into a bowl right now! A friend directed me to your site just as I was wondering what to make for dinner &#8211; your description and beautiful pictures were too tempting to ignore. Thanks for a great recipe. Simple, aromatic, sweet and a great use of a bag of drooping cherry tomatoes. Now. Must. Go. Eat.</p>

				<p>Not to be a huge dork, but 1/3 cup is around 4 or so tablespoons I think, so you are pretty much right on according to the recipe.  Looks yummy though.</p>

				<p>Ohhhh yes, that pasta sauce is a marvel. I&#8217;ve been making it since I saw it in the book and it&#8217;s one of my favorites. (And it is Nancy Harmon Jenkins&#8217;.) It truly ALWAYS tastes good. I can&#8217;t even imagine how good this must be with fresh pasta.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, </p>
<p>Delurking to say that your pasta looks beautiful, and I too love to surf the blogs for new recipes.  I actually made your pretzels last week and just blogged about them: <a href="http://victuals.blogs.masslive.com/default.asp?item=498949" rel="nofollow">http://victuals.blogs.masslive.com/default.asp?item=498949</a></p>

				<p>I keep a small box on a shelf in my kitchen, and all manners of old bread go into it. Crusts, cast-offs, stale buns etc, and when it&#8217;s full I take it out and put in through the food processor along with any old crackers or even chips and pretzels that have sat too long in the cupboards. Sometimes the bottom of the cereal bags go into it as well. What comes out is an amazing array of flavor that&#8217;s never the same twice but makes the most wonderful bread crumbs that I keep shut up tight in a container. It&#8217;s a treasure trove of convenience and goodness.</p>
<p>Oh Deb?? That recipe looks fantastic! Your site is always beautiful. And delicious.</p>

				<p>frightening really &#8211; i made something too similar for dinner last night!  though i didn&#8217;t use fresh pasta.  i haven&#8217;t made it fresh in a few months, and i miss it.  probably because i only eat pasta (for caloric reasons) when it is fresh because it is then, and only then, i feel it&#8217;s worth it.  I should really get on that.  a nice pasta dish is definitely in order and deserved ;).  Thanks for sharing.  I love your photos.  how do you get so much light!?  Are you just lucky enough to do these things during the day with lots or sunlight or do you stage the lighting?</p>

				<p>Marce  &#8212; Indeed. Between her site and 101 Cookbooks, I&#8217;m very jealous that I don&#8217;t have a graphic designer in house! I too was a little wary of roasting the cheeses for a &#8220;sauce&#8221; but it all worked out perfectly. Oh, and I added an extra clove of garlic, of course. ;)</p>
<p>Liz &#8212; What, Gmail has a tag function? Where have I been? Sometimes I feel like it&#8217;s Google&#8217;s world, I just live in it.  </p>
<p>Jenifer from Houston  &#8212; The Kitchen Aid stand mixer or the Cuisinart food processor? I vote for the latter, though I know that is blasphemy to some. I find I get much more use out of it. (Though speak to me when I actually have the counter space for my KA, this may change!)</p>
<p>mary &#8212; Indeed! I didn&#8217;t get to include this &#8220;story&#8221; but I have obviously been spending too much time watching the Food Network and not enough time watching the better cooking shows on PBS. Lately, I&#8217;ve been trying to catch a couple on the weekends, and it&#8217;s a whole new world! I am actually LEARNING things from watching a cooking show. Two weeks ago, I learned from Lydia Bastianach that it is more common to put bread crumbs (rather than cheese) on Southern Italian pasta dishes. (I hope I have this right, and do not offend anyway.) I had no idea, but after trying this, I can see why. </p>
<p>Jocelyn &#8212; I slipped over the edge, darling, when I made my own English muffins. The pasta, in comparison, is sane, logical and ridiculously easy.   </p>
<p>CurlyHairDay &#8212; That sounds delicious. Anything with marscapone is delicious. Drool. This reminds me, years ago, I had clipped a recipe from the NYTimes (?) called &#8220;burst cherry tomato sauce.&#8221; For the name, of course. But essentially, you heated oil with some slivers of garlic, threw in whole cherry tomatoes, put a lid on it, and let them cook until they popped. I think Nigella would call this &#8220;slutty&#8221; as in a very good thing. I must find it, and make it again.</p>
<p>carla  &#8212; Yup, definitely a lot more since we bought the machine, and I know how easy it is. Somehow it&#8217;s more worth it when it&#8217;s fresh. And ridiculously more filling.</p>
<p>Lily &#8212; Yay! A tried-and-true tester! (Whenever I find a new recipe on a food blog, I scroll down in the comments to see if anyone else made it, and if they liked it too, so I find your comment invaluable.) Thank you.</p>
<p>Nicole  &#8212; You are absolutely right. I&#8217;m evidently losing my ability to do conversions in my head. That said, this is where I admit that I didn&#8217;t measure very well, just estimated. I think one could get away with less oil, if they&#8217;re worried about an excess of calories. </p>
<p>Nell &#8212; Epicurious does indeed credit it to her. I must find more by this woman &#8212; she sounds fabulous.</p>
<p>Luisa &#8212; It was you! I found it on your site, I realized after the point. You didn&#8217;t blog about it, but just referenced it after making a pasta sauce I think you liked less. Thank you!</p>
<p>Patricia Scarpin &#8212; I agree! It&#8217;s the first recipe I ever used, and I thought I would flit around for awhile, trying more yolk-heavy and other varieties, but it works every time. Next up on the past agenda: replacing some flour with whole wheat, and finding a way to use basil to get an honest, vibrant green pasta, unaided by food dyes. I&#8217;ve got plans for it!</p>
<p>Jennifer Adams  &#8212; Stunning! Lovely job! The chocolateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I fear for when Alex sees those pictures, as &#8220;add chocolate&#8221; is pretty much his suggestion for every single recipe.</p>
<p>Erica &#8212; Oooh, capers. I love that idea.</p>
<p>Kate &#8212; Thanks for the idea. I really should do that. Especially considering the scraps and crumbs I always accumulate from my own homemade breads! Brilliant.</p>
<p>Linda &#8212; It wasn&#8217;t very light at all (though we do have overhead lighting) and I lightened it quite a bit in a photo editor. (Hence the slighty grainy quality.) Photos on this site are almost always divided into two camps: desserts, which I usually make in advance or have leftovers of so can take in daylight (they always, always look better) or dinner meals, eaten late and photos taken when I was impatient to eat (always need editing). But these are better because Alex took most of them.</p>

				<p>Wow look at me..my husbands aunt always made home made noodles..the ones I have tried in the past have been a gloppy mess and not even comparable. I used the machine and this wonderful dough like silly putty formed, they rolled easy and did not bond and stick to the previous cuttings, when I served this up my husband got a little emotional, has not had this favorite of his, beef and noodles since his aunt passed on. Thank you for the inspiration to try just one more time.</p>

				<p>Deb, your choice of pasta and condiment are incredible.  Oven roasting is the best thing a cook can do to resuscitate flavour in a typical tomato.  I must agree with you, however, that cherry and grape tomatoes usually do have decent flavour au naturel.  Thanks also for telling it like it is on the breadcrumb front.  Have you ever tried making Sicilian bread crumb topping by taking your bread crumbs and toasting them with some olive oil?  It&#8217;s a poor man&#8217;s parmesan.  It&#8217;s also the way my wife and I frequently use our leftover/stale bread.  I found this recipe:<br />

				<p>Thanks for this recipe &#8212; tried it out last night, and it was a big hit, at least with my husband and myself. The kids (4 &amp; 6) helped cook, but wouldn&#8217;t do anything more than taste the barest fragment of a corner of the tomatoes.</p>
<p>I used the lower amount of oil; 1/3 cup would have overwhelmed, I think, though it could also make it more of a dressing for the pasta. But since we weren&#8217;t using a whole recipe of pasta, 3Tbsp worked out fine.</p>

				<p>OK, I made this tonight and that was <i>good</i>. Putting all those little half tomatoes face up in the baking dish was a little bit of a zen exercise, but the rest of it was easy enough to make up for that. And dang &#8212; yummy. Definitely one for the files.</p>

				<p>When do you recommend adding the basil?<br />
I was not sure if I was to add it to the hot pasta and sauce in a bowl, or add it to the tomatoes before the breadcrumbs.</p>

				<p>Okay, I know I&#8217;m almost a year late, but I made this tonight after seeing it linked under the 7-yolk pasta. I didn&#8217;t have time to make fresh pasta, but this was delicious over whole-wheat spaghetti! The aroma is still lingering in my kitchen a few hours later, and it is truly a thing of beauty.</p>

				<p>I am a  year late also &#8211; but I just made this for my husband and myself and it turned out so fresh tasting and delicious. Honestly, I was a little surprised that he liked a pasta that was not dripping in sauce since that is usually the main criteria!  We are adding this to our regular list, based on a promise I made to double the bread crumb mixture. :)</p>
<p>Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<p>Another person that is a year late&#8230; you saved a box of grape tomatoes from oblivion.  :-)<br />
I added some prosciutto to this in the last 10 minutes of cooking so it would get nice and crispy.  The husband voted that this should be added to the regular rotation!!!<br />
Thanks very much for your wonderful blog!</p>

Only I&#8217;d call it &#8220;Busted Cherry Tomato Sauce,&#8221; ’cause I&#8217;m really a 14-year-old boy. Heheh.</p>

				<p>This is one of my all-time favorite recipes!  I&#8217;ve made a slightly different version of it for years and it is always amazing.  I sometimes make it with romas when they are super cheep in the farmer&#8217;s markets or (to make a *really* pretty dinner) with baby heirloom tomatoes.  They are so pretty, it&#8217;s like eating a bowl of rainbows.  This recipe is impossible to mess up.</p>
<p>Nancy- You throw the basil in at the end when you mix the tomatoes with the pasta.</p>

				<p>Might you have used a metal baking dish? It may have reacted with the acidity of the tomatoes.</p>

				<p>This recipe inspired me to to change up my spaghetti sauce recipe. I took my 20 pounds of tomatoes and cored them, sliced them in half and poured olive oil in a cookie sheet with a small lip on it. I sprinkled sea salt on liberally. I roasted them on my gas grill at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes. When they have cooled a bit I squeezed out the extra juice and pulverized them in the cusinart. I roasted some sweet onions and garlic in the same manner and added them to the cusinart. At the end I tossed in some basil and a splash of balsamic vinegar. I then processed bottles of the sauce in a boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Yum! And Easy for alot of end of summer tomatoes.</p>

				<p>A few years late, but glad to find this recipe tonight. One twist that takes the sauce in a different direction: add in a few anchovy filets before baking and then mix them in with the sauce over the noodles. Lovely.</p>

				<p>I made this last night, and it was delicious!! I even made the pasta using your recipe, and without a pasta making machine&#8230;.a little more time consuming, especially to cut it, but it still came out awesome! The only question I have is that you mention basil in the list of ingredients, but in your directions I couldn&#8217;t find where to add it&#8230;I assume at the end? All your recipes that I have tried have been awesome&#8230;thanks for making me a better cook and baker!</p>

				<p>I made this last night, but with store-bought whole wheat pasta.  The store-bought because I&#8217;m lazy; the whole wheat because I had to run long-distance today.  Anyway, the sauce part turned out really well (what more would I expect?) but the pasta sort of brought it down a notch, both due to its texture and some incidents with the stove and the pot of water.  I&#8217;ll probably make this with white pasta sometime- I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll turn out amazingly well!</p>

				<p>Hey Deb, about to write about this (finally) on my site, and as I read through your post and looked at the Epicurious recipe page, realized that the last step of the recipe is omitted! As it reads in the book, in the final step, you remove the tomatoes from the oven, mash them with a fork, mixing the topping in with the tomatoes, drizzle in the remaining oil and throw in the torn basil leaves, then mix with the drained pasta. :) Do you even read comments this far back? Hi! xo</p>

				<p>I just made this the other night, but I roasted it with the basil (instructions didn&#8217;t say what to do with it, so I put it on top of the tomatoes).  And once it was done, I added in a sliced roasted red onion, 2 small roasted zucchini &#8211; sliced, and some cooked ground Italian sausage.  It was delightful!  The sweetness of the roasted veggies against the slight tartness of cherry tomatoes &#8211; utterly addicting!</p>

				<p>I made this dish last night with fresh pasta and although I wanted to love it (I mean, what&#8217;s not to love?) it came out dreadfully dry.  Did anyone else have this problem? Perhaps next time I&#8217;ll try to save some of the pasta water to make it more saucey but, for me, this one was rather a dud :(</p>

				<p>I made this yesterday with my last of the season cherry tomatoes but used regular pasta.  I agree it was dry but it was pretty tasty anyway.  Maybe you really need that 1/3 c. olive oil.  I used a few tablespoons of the pasta water but of course it moistened the crunchy topping.  I tossed the basil into the pasta and tomatoes as I mixed them up.  I also decided to top with a few cubes of fresh mozzarella for serving, but mostly because I had some to use up.   I like the idea of tossing in some onion and zukes for more veggies as well as moistness.  Will try that next time.</p>

				<p>with the weather warming up in philly (50s, almost tropical compared to the blizzard of 3 weeks ago), I was browsing your recipe list and this jumped out at me. I added some fresh chopped buffalo mozzarella and basil upon plating and OH MY GOD. spring/summer on a plate. going back from seconds now!<br />
THANKS!</p>
