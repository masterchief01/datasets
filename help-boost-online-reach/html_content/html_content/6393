<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/blondies-for-a-blondie/" title="blondies, infinitely adaptable "><img src="http://static.flickr.com/50/149257661_012d51d195.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="blondies, infinitely adaptable " /></a></p>
I&#8217;m back! But not really, as I got home an hour ago, whipped up a batch of the only blondie recipe you&#8217;ll ever need for our <a href="http://pixxiestails.com">favorite blondie&#8217;s</a> umpteenth 25th birthday and now I have about 45 minutes to find something in my closet that camouflages my sling because ugh, it&#8217;s such an eyesore. (On the flipside, when I don&#8217;t wear it and someone bumps into me I get all outraged like &#8216;don&#8217;t you know my shoulder is injured?!&#8217; Well, no Debbie, they don&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Although I am certain the last thing anyone wants to think about today is eating, baking, desserts or the next big cooking holiday, this recipe will usher in what I hope will be a month peppered with ideas for gifty kitchen confections. I know a lot of people this time of year make small gifts bags of baked goods, or larger tins for parties, and while I typically don&#8217;t, this gives me a chance, too, to try out a lot of bookmarked recipes while also never showing up at a party empty-handed. Also, I finally have an excuse to buy a candy thermometer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/306056992/" title="blondies"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/119/306056992_74cc9fe5c0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="blondies" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-99"></span></p>
<p>Of course, this recipe is nothing new. I&#8217;ve been making it for nearly two years now because it&#8217;s simple the tastiest and easiest &#8212; one bowl! &#8212; baked goods to whip up for a party. It&#8217;s denser than chocolate chip cookies, more complex than brownies and in the classic Minimalist style, you&#8217;ve can customize it anywhere from a cranberry almond coconut bar to the gunky atery-cloggers I&#8217;m best known for. I typically load up on whatever chocolate I have around &#8212; tonight it was milk, white and bittersweet &#8212; finely chop some walnuts or pecans, use dark brown sugar, European butter and in something you will probably sense is a theme with me, add a splash of bourbon to boot. Gild the lily? Oh, not me. Never. </p>
<p>Finally, I double the recipe, baking it in a 9&#215;13 pan (though really, just because I don&#8217;t have an 8&#215;8 &#8212; yet) and cut the pieces really small, almost like cubes so we can rest assured that we&#8217;re not overdoing it. Oh no, not us. Never.</p>

<p>8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces or 113 grams) butter, melted<br />
1 cup (218 grams or 7 3/4 ounces for light; 238 grams or 8 3/8 ounces for dark) brown sugar<br />
1 large egg<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br />
Pinch salt<br />
1 cup (4 3/8 ounces or 125 grams) all-purpose flour</p>
<ol>
<li>Butter an 8&#215;8 pan</li>
<li>Mix melted butter with brown sugar &#8211; beat until smooth. Beat in egg and then vanilla.	</li>
<li>Add salt, stir in flour. Mix in any additions (below).</li>
<li>Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 350&#176;F 20-25 minutes, or until set in the middle. I always err on the side of caution with baking times &#8212; nobody ever complained about a gooey-middled cookie. Cool on rack before cutting them.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Further additions, use one or a combination of: </i></p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 to 1 cup chopped nuts, toasting them first for even better flavor</li>
<li>1/2 to 1 cup chocolate chips</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon mint extract in addition to or in place of the vanilla</li>
<li>1/2 cup mashed bananas</li>
<li>1/4 cup bourbon, scotch or other whiskey; increase the flour by one tablespoon</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of espresso powder with the vanilla</li>
<li>Stir 1/2 cup dried fruit, especially dried cherries, into the prepared batter</li>
<li>Top with a vanilla butter cream or chocolate peanut butter cream frosting</li>
</ul>

				<p>mmmmm, what a great sounding basic recipe &#8211; will try this soon! My search for recipes is always a search for the base to more complex things &#8211; like the basic pancake recipe, which can be spiced up, substituted and tweaked until the cows come home. It is so helpful to know the ratios that make everything turn out like the thing we expect them to be like (pancake-like, cookie-like, cake-like, quick-break-like, and so on)</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m about to cook a second batch, in 3 days, of your coffee cake&#8230;first one was for fiance back at the real home, second one for relatives at thanksgiving feast&#8230;that one goes very high on my baked goods list</p>

				<p>This is very interesting that you melt the butter and the sugar&#8230; I like when things get intriguing. Is this dark or light brown sugar&#8211; have you made them with both??</p>
<p>Peanut butter is also a great addition, can help to make them even chewier.</p>

				<p>Rachael &#8211; If you like adapting recipes, you should really check out How to Cook Everything. Alex bought it in his woebegone bachelor days, heh, and the entire book is recipes and then endless adaptation. The instructions are so clear and simple, and really, it has a recipe for almost anything. Of course, one of the problems with this approach is that you have to guess when, which and how many additions will be beneficial, and when you should just stick with the core recipe. Should you use Ã‚Â½ cup or 1 cup of chocolate chips? It&#8217;s a big range. Of course this was an easy choice: all of the above! But would all of those additions be good in a cookie? Probably not. </p>
<p>Glad you loved the coffee cake.</p>
<p>Shuna &#8211; See, I found that step brilliant. One, I wholly admit that I love the laziness involved in only having to melt and not cream room-temperature butter, because when is it ever room temperature when you need it? But two, because when you&#8217;re making a cookie, you shouldn&#8217;t really need all that air beaten into the butter that you would need when making a cake, right? I&#8217;d think that the lack of creaming would make for a more crisp cookie. I&#8217;ve made it with both light and dark brown sugars &#8211; this time, I used both because I only had some of each &#8211; and each way, it&#8217;s wonderful, the darker of course having a more intense flavor. I applaud your suggestion of peanut butter.</p>
<p>Elle &#8211; And so easy! Let me/us know if you try it.</p>
<p>Tanna &#8211; Me too! I love it when a recipe-writer tests it both ways, and realizes you lose nothing by saving a dish &#8211; perfect, as our sink is already stacked with stuff we didn&#8217;t get to washing before running out for the weekend. Blech!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m glad to have this in the arsenal&#8211;the America&#8217;s Test Kitchen blondie recipe made some great bars, but seemed awfully fussy to me (though that&#8217;s sorta why I love them, too). </p>
<p>This holiday is going to be my first excursion into the world of giving seriously high-quality but not-requiring-backbreaking-kitchen-labor home-baked gifts, so I&#8217;m looking forward to all of your posts for the next few weeks! (And beyond, of course&#8230;)</p>

				<p>Even though I just ate my breakfast, this recipe made my stomach growl loudly. I may have to make them as soon as we run out of Thanksgiving pie and birthday cake.</p>

<p>THANK YOU!!  For everything.  It was a great night, although I am still trying to piece together what happened.</p>

				<p>I have one silly question, when a recipe calls for butter is it always assumed to be unsalted butter? These blondies are in the oven right now, I can&#8217;t wait to taste them.</p>

				<p>I made these using unsalted butter, dried blueberries, chocolate chips and walnuts. My six year old tried some after dinner, and came to me and said, &#8220;Mom, these are the BEST DESSERT EVER.&#8221; Then I got a big hug and &#8220;Thanks so much for making those.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is the kid who won&#8217;t touch nuts, by the way. And i have never gotten a HUG for making cookies before.  Definitely a keeper&#8211;easy recipe!  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Deb, thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I absolutely love dried cherries, so I tried the cherries, white chocolate, coconut and walnut version. They were to die for. I love this recipe because it can be made quickly with whatever ingredients I happen to have on hand and with very little clean-up.</p>

				<p>I tried these today and they turned out way too gooey(and I like a gooey center as much as the next person) even after I practically doubled the baking time. I&#8217;m thinking my oven temperature is really off or my mistake was the fact that I mixed the other ingredients into the saucepan I melted the butter in and it was very warm(the chocolate chips ended up melting almost immediately). Did everyone else cool the butter to room temp. or cooler first?</p>

				<p>Oh no! That&#8217;s terrible. My first thought was &#8220;god, Deb, not everyone loves bourbon the way you do. For real!&#8221; but believe it or not, those are Mark Bittman suggestions from his cookbook, not even mine! Good to know for the future. Sorry you learned the hard way.</p>

				<p>I found this recipe (and everyone&#8217;s helpful comments) a few weeks ago. Now it&#8217;s all my husband asks for! Thanks Deb and commenters! </p>
<p>Chocolate chips and pecans are part of the basic version for us, but as we&#8217;re big bourbon and espresso fans, I&#8217;ve been playing with those two add-ins. When I used 2T of espresso, the bourbon got lost. Halved the espresso and it disappeared, leaving us with bourbon cubes (not that we minded). Tonight&#8217;s plan is to try 1.5T of espresso and a scant 1/4c of maker&#8217;s. Cross your fingers please.</p>

				<p>Hi, I was having a massive food craving last night and was desperate to find something I could bake with the ingredients on hand. This recipe did the trick. I actually have &#8220;How to Cook Everything&#8221; but can&#8217;t currently find it.<br />
I added 1/4 cup of light rum and 1/2 cup of coconut to the basic recipe and my husband was delighted.<br />
Thank you so much.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve got this recipe in the oven now&#8230; looking at the software list, it reminds me a lot of the recipe for &#8220;Butterscotch Bars&#8221; that my grandma swiped out of an old Better Homes and Gardens book.  The only real difference being that recipe included baking powder, so the blondies have a bit more &#8220;loft&#8221; than these probably will.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, it was the variations that hooked me to try this one &#8211; I put bourbon in my blondies ;-)</p>
<p>Cheers, kids&#8230;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made two batches of these so far and they are awesome!  Has anyone noticed that they taste even better after about 3-5 days of being left at room temp?  I think the flavors really have a chance to meld together.  I know it&#8217;s not easy to wait that long but save at least one and try it!</p>

				<p>Oh my!  I have had this recipe printed out for a few weeks, and was just waiting for a reason to try it out.  I decided that reason was going to be the celebration of my husband and I recovering from the flu!  I used walnuts and semisweet chocolate chips, and they are absolutely to die for!  So easy, so quick, so delicious.  Now I just can&#8217;t wait to get to the grocery to make those cherry-coconut-almond ones you mentioned above.  Thanks for yet another foolproof recipe, Deb!</p>

				<p>these are in the oven baking right now.  i went with white chocolate, craisins, and a splash of chambord.  can&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s no baking powder or soda, or leavening of any kind  &#8211; but they smell divine.  baby fell asleep in the kitchen, so i must bake!  at this rate, i&#8217;ll never lose the baby weight.</p>

I looked up a few recipes and decided to settle on yours.  I doubled the batch and added chocolate chips.  They were delicious (and they went fast)!

				<p>These are delicious. I&#8217;m on my second batch inside a week. Both with dark chocolate chunks, pecans and dried sour cherries. They feel positively healthy compared to my favourite brownie recipe (which uses a pound of dark chocolate, close to a pound of butter and 8 eggs!). Trisha, how an earth did you discover they taste better after 3-5 days? These are out of the oven and gone! Thank you for an amazing blog (deliciously tempting photos) and a great recipe.</p>

				<p>Unbelievably easy. I wish I had found this recipe before. I was just tasting blondies and had to make them.  I didn&#8217;t have the whiskey or the bourbon but I did have some Grand Marnier (orange liqueur). I put a shot of that in the recipe with milk choc chips, semi sweet choc chips, and walnuts. Unbelievable. Especially with some fresh chocolate chip ice cream. Thank you so much. I&#8217;m making a batch for my mom next week.</p>

				<p>Just phenomenal and so easy! I threw in a good 3/4 cup of toffee pieces and a little over 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Baking took more like 35 minutes and the center was still on the gooey side, but the end product was worth the wait!</p>

				<p>I stumbled into your site whilst trying to decipher what the heck went wrong with the ratios in the  blondie recipe I was working on. My friend shot me a recipe for coconut blondies, but it was more like a mediocre coconut cake, with the butter and sugar creamed and all that. Anyhow, those hit the bin, and it was time for round two! I used your base recipe with a smidge of coconut cream and a whole lot of shredded coconut. As soon as my knife cut into these, I knew they were gonna be great!!<br />

				<p>Yeeks &#8212; it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve made these and can&#8217;t remember. I would start checking at 30 minutes (the thickness will have a lot to do with baking time, of course) and then go every five minutes from there when they&#8217;re not done.</p>

				<p>I just made these last night and doubled the recipe.  In a 9 x 13 &#8221; pan, they were done at 30 minutes (they come out a little thinner then the ones pictured).  I added dried cranberries, chocolate chips, a tablespoon of espresso powder and about a shot of whiskey.  They came out very moist and very very good (melting the butter helps with that).  Next time will try the espresso and white chocolate.</p>

				<p>wow! so easy and delicious, as everyone has already observed. I put in half a cup of toasted pecans, 1/4 cup of bourbon and 1/3 cup of bittersweet choc chips. I did think I could have left them in the oven another five minutes (I baked them for about 25 mins) but maybe that&#8217;s just my oven. deb, maybe i too love bourbon too much, but i didn&#8217;t find 1/4 cup to be too much. though licking the mixing bowl was a, um, heady experience.</p>

				<p>I made these yesterday and they turned out yummy!  My variation was to mix in approx. 3/4 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips, approx. 3/4 c. walnuts, 1/2 c. dried cherries (snipped, so as to mix into the batter more evenly), 1/2 tsp. almond extract, and 2 T. bourbon.  I didn&#8217;t add extra flour, since I didn&#8217;t add the full amount of bourbon.  Also, I used a 9&#215;9 inch pan, since that&#8217;s what I have.  In spite of an oven that has the world&#8217;s craziest thremostat, the blondies came out perfect!  I probably baked them for about 21-22 minutes.  I will be revisiting your blog often and trying other recipes soon.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>i came across this recipe and really want to try it but i was wandering if you or anyone could tell me the equivalent weight of a tablespoon of butter in either grams or ounces. I am English and am not familiar with these types of measurements, so if anyone could let me know that would be great! :)</p>

				<p>The best blondies I&#8217;ve ever had were served at a meeting in Chicago seven years ago. I&#8217;ve checked every bakery I&#8217;ve stepped foot in on the west coast since then, and none have even sold blondies. I&#8217;ve done several Internet searches for recipes and decided on this one&#8230;based on the ease of the recipe and everyone&#8217;s positive comments. My two 8&#215;8 inch pans of blondies are in the oven baking right now&#8211;one with about a cup of butterscotch chips and the other with butterscotch chips and chopped pecans. I didn&#8217;t go the bourbon route&#8211;the only liquor in this house is tequila, but I did use some imported Mexican vanilla that has a pure, wonderful flavor. </p>
<p>Thanks for your site, and all the tips and suggestions. Happy new year to all.</p>

				<p>I was so excited to make these blondies.  First try I doubled the recipe and used cherries, walnuts and chocolate chips.  They were flat and a kind of dry and  ordinary.  I tried again thinking that maybe I shouldn&#8217;t double up.  I used an 8X8 pan and used mashed bananas, walnuts and chocolate chips and a T. of brandy. Still flat and less than impressive.  What happened?  Could it be the weather or that  I used room temperature butter instead of melting it?  Maybe they&#8217;ll taste better in the morning.</p>

				<p>These are crazy business. I doubled the recipe and threw in chocolate chunks and white chocolate drops. AMAZING! I had used another recipe and was really sad that they came out more like scones, so trooped on and found yours! I was gloating for about two days. Well, this is the second day so it hasn&#8217;t really stopped. Next time I&#8217;ll kill the bottle of Woodford on the bridge and try caramel bits with almonds. Thanks so much! I&#8217;m going to have to bake these for my parents. I usually make dumplings on Chinese New Year but this may be my new tradition!! </p>
<p>P.S. I forgot and actually creamed the butter and sugar, but it came out as gorgeous as the pics so dont worry if you did accidentally.  I&#8217;ll follow the next time..</p>

				<p>I recently baked blondies from a recipe I found some where else and they weren&#8217;t so great. Last night, I decided to try once more and searched online for a better recipe, coming across this one I just knew I had to try it. I doubled the recipe for my 13 x 9 pan and used about half a cup of butterscotch chips, a cup of chocolate chips and about a half of a cup of hersheys chocolate chunks, I also added 1/4 cup of whiskey. My boyfriend, being very impatient ate them fresh out of the oven and said &#8216;they are ..good&#8217;. Haha. I had some after they cooled completey and they are by far the best I have ever had and so very delicious. I can&#8217;t wait for him to try them again so he can tell me what he really thinks of them! Oh and my mom adored them! This is a great recipe and I can&#8217;t wait to try other options like the dried cherries! I also love using one bowl! Woohoo! well done!!!!</p>

				<p>I love this recipe! I used dark chocolate and white chocolate chunks, and instead of bourbon I used Amaretto and served them with caramel sauce and ice cream. The first time I made them I added walnuts and cherries but I found them to be better without. I love the variations and that they are a people pleaser and so easy!</p>

				<p>I just discovered Marble Blondies! I used the recipe stated above, but I melted the butter in the microwave in the mixer bowl. Then I added the other ingredients, but when I added the chocolate chips, they melted due to the heat of the bowl from melting the  butter. So they are now Marble Blondies,delicious!</p>

				<p>I am going to try these out this week, thanks for posting it. They look great. However, I own that cookbook and can not find the recipe anywhere in it. do you have an older version that maybe has different recipes than the newer copy? Or am I just totally blind? also I was wondering if you are supposed to use unsalted butter? I am assuming that you are.</p>

				<p>Bittman calls them &#8220;Butterscotch Brownies&#8221; but I find that name confusing. You can use unsalted or salted, depending on your taste. I like more salt in sweet things so I use salted.</p>

				<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have one RAVE and one quick question. I just made these because a coworker requested Blondies. I had never made them, I always felt like blondies were brownies without the good part (chocolate!). </p>
<p>That said, I mixed in a good cup or so of coconut flakes, ghiradelli white and semi sweet choco chips and walnuts and its crazy good!!! My roomate just said that she is no longer a brownie girl but a blondie girl so they are definitely up for the task of satisfying friends.</p>
<p>My question is that most other blondie recipes I saw included baking powder/soda. Why did you choose to leave them out, are they substantially cake-ier with those ingredients?  I was so surprised at how very very thick and goopy the batter was before baking up. They turned out amazing but I&#8217;m wondering if i&#8217;ll get more of a brownie consistency if i add 1/2-1 tsp of baking powder/soda.</p>

				<p>Some blondies recipes have baking powder/soda in them, others do not. Same with brownies &#8212; in fact, two of my favorite brownie recipes don&#8217;t use baking powder/soda at all. The inclusion makes it more of a cake (brownies/blondies are technically in the cookie family, believe it or not). There&#8217;s no harm in including it if you&#8217;d like it better, of course.</p>

				<p>First time I made the base recipe it was a little too gooey for me, but the second time: Bourbon Pecan Blondies!  I made these as above, with the following adjustments: I added 2T bourbon and 1/4 cup flour, plus toasted chopped pecans and used 1/2 t vanilla instead of 1t. So easy that I&#8217;m already thinking up new versions; subbing some maple sugar and adding dried blueberries comes to mind&#8230;Thanks!</p>

				<p>This recipe is the perfect blondie recipe. I have made it twice now. Once I used chopped dates and dried cherries. They were delicious! Last night I used 1/2 cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and I chopped about 8 ounces of dark chocolate up. That batch turned out the best! I&#8217;ll definitely be making these regularly.</p>

				<p>Can I just tell you: this has become one of my signature desserts.  I never used to like blondies, but these are just so darn easy and so very delicious.  I use 3 Tbs bourbon, 1/3 cup chopped dark chocolate, and 1/3 cup chopped milk chocolate.  The bourbon is just so fruity and boozy and the milk chocolate is caramel-y and the dark chocolate is just a little bit bitter and oh jeez I think I&#8217;ll go make some right now!</p>

				<p>I needed a dessert that will travel well with me on a bus.</p>
<p>I made a double batch with slightly less than 1/2 cup Jim Beam and 1 2/3 cup chocolate chips. Baking just over 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The bourbon is not too strong at all and I sprinkled the top with an extra ounce while they were still warm. Most people will probably not even be able to tell what it is, just a little extra flavor. My boyfriend guessed they had banana in them.</p>
<p>Overall very easy to make but I still prefer my one bowl Baker&#8217;s brownies for flavor. The blondies stuck terribly to the pan despite liberal buttering. </p>
<p>I will make this again if I am in the mood for blondies. If I put alcohol in I will use even more. Grand Marnier brownies are one of my specialties so I do love baking with alcohol.</p>

				<p>Was having a discussion with my sister and cousins about blondies, i think Dunan Hines used to make a mix when we were kids, my Aunt Judy always had them, alongside of brownies.<br />
Anyway. Had to do a search for a recipe, to make a double batch for work&#8230; thanks Deb, Molly and Emily&#8230; Looked perfect just a little after 30 min, and i used a disposable pan (hello, not doing washing up at work, LOL).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know how they are received. But they smell amazing, and I wish I made a batch for us at home&#8230; we are dying to try them. Thanks!!</p>

				<p>this is a great gooey chewy recipe- 99% of people loose their minds over these&#8230;however I am one of the few in the minority and I like a cakey, light, blondie (crazy, i know) but with full flavor. any suggestions?</p>

				<p>You can always add an extra tablespoon or two of flour and bake it longer. You also might be interested in just using a more <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/crispy-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/" rel="nofollow">classic chocolate chip cookie recipe</a>, and pressing it into a pan instead.</p>

				<p>The recipe should have stated Dark brown sugar, tightly packed.  Light brown will work too, but dark brown is more molasses-y, and has more flavor.  I love the idea of adding a sweet liquor, like bourbon or rum, and will definitely try that.  yum!  Also, I add butterscotch chips, a whole bag, whenever I make these.  Underbake a little for a gooey sugar treat.  And I love the idea of combining chocolate and butterscotch chips, and will try that too. </p>
<p>Has anyone tried adding kahlua?  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about the mint&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ll bet coconut would be great in these, or as frosting, but I don&#8217;t know how much to add.  Has anyone tried this?  I could make a buttercream and add coconut, but how much could be added before they fall apart/don&#8217;t bake together?</p>
<p>thank you.  Just discovered this website, and I love it already.</p>

				<p>Deb </p>
<p>After years of buying recipe books and fostering a severe baking addiction I started trawling cooking blogs a few months ago and discovered your site. It has been bookmarked for a while now and I really enjoy trying your recipes. I just wanted to say what a big hit this recipe has been. I have made it with all sorts of additions. My work colleagues are generally the recipient of my baking endeavours and the most sweet-toothed of them tells me that this is his favourite of all the treats I have brought in. Particularly popular are blondies with white chocolate, dried sour cherries and pistachios. Have run out of sour cherries and the batch currently in the oven includes white and 70% chocolate chips, dried pear and pistachios. </p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for introducing me to such a versatile, delicious and easy recipe.</p>

				<p>Made this recipe twice recently.  Both times I doubled everything and baked in a 13 x 9 inch pan for 35 &#8211; 40 minutes.  I added shredded coconut, almonds, and some chocolate chips.  My brothers and boyfriend love them and they are so easy to make.  Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<p>Oh Deb, these really are heart-breakingly good.  I made them with Amaretto, bittersweet choc chips, and big chunks of pecans.  They blew our minds.  I&#8217;ve made them at least 4 times since.  Most recently I doubled the recipe and made them in a 9&#215;13 pan&#8230; they came out a little thicker and oh so divine&#8230; we&#8217;re more in love than ever (with both the blondies and each other&#8230; he loves when I bake).<br />
And I must add that this isn&#8217;t the only recipe of yours we&#8217;ve adored.  It&#8217;s gotten so that when I say a new recipe is from Smitten Kitchen we have great expectations!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made double batches of these on several occasions: twice with 1 c. toasted hazelnuts, 1 c. chocolate chips, 3/4 tsp hazelnut flavoring and 1/4 c. bourbon (my Nutella-loving friend couldn&#8217;t get enough), and once with 2 bananas, chocolate chips, and 1/4 c. bourbon, baking ~30 min.  They never last longer than 2 days!</p>

				<p>I made these a few weeks ago for friends.  Everyone was dying over how delicious they were&#8230; of course that might be because they were buzzed from all the bourbon I put in (just kidding).  I doubled the recipe (including the bourbon at about a 1/2 cup!) and cooked it in a 9&#215;12 pan.  I also added toasted pecans, plus white, milk and dark chocolate chips.  It needed to cook quite a bit longer than  the time stated (almost 40 minutes) and tasted VERY strongly of bourbon when it came out of the oven.  However, when it cooled they were to die for!  My husband even put them out for a poker game (figuring bourbon soaked anything was a perfect choice) to rave reviews.  I had said that the next time I made these I would cut the bourbon in half, but  everyone who ate them said not change a thing!  Who am I to argue with the will of the people?!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these often, but a recent careless mistake turned into a favorite new variation: instead of just melting the butter, try simmering it with the sugar and salt for a few moments until darkened in color and bubbly, and then let cool and proceed.  The texture of the finished blondies will be chewier, and the flavor has notes of caramel and brown butter &#8211; absolutely wonderful with toasted pecans or hazenuts added in, along with dark chocolate.</p>

				<p>Have a batch in the oven with cognac, cranberries, dark chocolate chips, coconut, and swirled some homemade caramel on the top and cracked some smokey salt as a finish. They look wonderful and smell better. I&#8217;m sure they will be exquisite. Been dying for a good blondie for a week now and this basic recipe was just what I needed. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Oh Heavens! I just made these with coconut, golden raisins, and chocolate chips. I only had 3/4 cup of brown sugar so I added 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. I also don&#8217;t have an 8&#215;8 so I used a 9-inch cake pan. The edges were a little more done that I would prefer, but it was easy to trim the crust and cut the rest into bite-size pieces.

				<p>YUM! I&#8217;ve had your recipe bookmarked for months now, and finally made blondies last night. they were so good and so simple and just what I needed! I had a question &#8211; was your brown sugar packed? I packed mine and my blondies turned out to be considerably sweeter than I&#8217;d have liked. I did also simmer the butter and sugar together halfway to butterscotch sauce, so I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the reason they were too sweet.</p>

				<p>8:05pm I was feeling like a brownie but my husband wanted a chocolate chip cookie. We decided on a blondie as a compromise. I looked up a few recipes and settled on this one. I love all the feedback, that was why I chose this recipe. 8:05pm the blondies are in the oven. 8:30 there out. 9:00 I&#8217;m tasting them,9:30 I&#8217;m having another&#8230; get my drift. 5 stars, I love them. I added a little coconut just to be a little more creative. when well with the chocolate chips. Thanks</p>

				<p>Hi! I&#8217;m thinking about making these for a new years party, and I want to make it for a 9 x 13 pan.. How should I adjust the recipe? Should I double it? And if I add chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, should I reduce the sugar a little to balance out the sweetness, or do you think it would taste fine the way it is?</p>

				<p>Have you ever checked your oven&#8217;s temperature? It might run a little hot. Or brown things very strongly (my newer oven is like this; thing often brown before they&#8217;re baked). Did they taste okay once cool?</p>

				<p>Thanks for the tip about the oven. I will definitely check it out. I&#8217;m living in campus apartments so it&#8217;s not the most high tech of kitchens. And yes, these tasted AMAZING. I added some semi-sweet and white chocolate chunks&#8230;it was like chocolate chip cookies on steroids! Once I figure out my oven I will be making these again.</p>

				<p>I just made these for a holiday treat for my husband. I made them with espresso and toffee chips and white chocolate on top.  I also added 1t. molasses. </p>
<p>The flavor was nice but the texture was very gooey. Even with an extra 5 min of baking.  Maybe due to the 2T. of espresso?<br />
Next time, I&#8217;ll bump up the flour a bit.</p>

				<p>Spectacular recipe! Even without any add-ins, this would be fantastic, but the ability to just look in your cupboard and say &#8220;What do I feel like putting in these?&#8221;&#8230; I love it.</p>
<p>My second (double) batch just came out of the oven and I am barely resisting diving headfirst into it with my bare hands.</p>
<p>First batch was a couple of weeks ago for a Christmas party &#8212; I had to bring a boozy dessert &#8212; whipped up a batch of these with a very generous splash of rye and some chopped homemade candied ginger. Mouthwatering. I topped them with some of the large gingery sugar crystals leftover from the candying&#8230; Mmmmmm. They didn&#8217;t last too long at the party.</p>
<p>This batch (for another party tomorrow, because the only time I really bake is when I know I&#8217;ll have someone to share with!) is a chocolate-candy cane blondie &#8212; a teeeensy splash of peppermint extract with the vanilla, then some chocolate chips, chopped leftover mini Toblerones, semi-finely chopped candy canes&#8230; all topped with more candy cane crumbs. It smells like I&#8217;ve died and gone to heaven. Can&#8217;t wait to dig in!</p>

				<p>There is a HUGE PROBLEM with the above recipie!!! I doubled the recipie as the author indicated with a 9&#215;13 inch baking pan. It seems that you also need to increase the time, but it does not indicate by how much. There is no baking soda or baking powder listed in the recipie and the blondies are basically goo in the middle. They are not setting up. Next time, I would stick to the original 8&#215;8 pan recipie and add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda.  Frankly, I&#8217;m disappointed.</p>

				<p>whoa, deb.  I love you and I&#8217;ve made plenty of your recipes, but these really fell flat (literally).  Should there be a rising agent added?  I was so excited to make these, they looked so scrumptious in your pics, but mine did not look like yours!  Very flat and kind of hard/ugly.  I had in mind soft, gooey, you know, brownie-like&#8230;</p>

				<p>I was desperate to make these and I didn&#8217;t have an 8 x 8 so I did it in a spring form pan. It was fine, just different shaped portions.<br />
I browned the butter, then added 1/2 cup coconut, 1/2 cup pecans, and a heaping 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Oh, and I used hazelnut extract instead of vanilla.<br />
Delicious!<br />
If you use the &#8216;whisk and wait&#8217; method from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated the toffee flavor comes through more.  I browned the butter whisked it into the brown sugar, added eggs and extract, then waited for 2 minutes.  I repeated that pattern twice, whisking it for a bout 30 seconds, then waiting for about a minute.  It should look like a gooey toffee ribbon in the bowl. This process allows the sugar to dissolve more into the butter and eggs and it helps create the crispy outside.  Try it with chocolate chip cookies-the texture is great.</p>
<p>And just for kicks, I made this dough again, froze it, then rolled it up into tiny balls and put it in homemade vanilla ice cream.  Best chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream ever!</p>

				<p>I made a batch of these last night and they turned out absolutely yummy.  I made mine with choc chips and pecans and reduced the fat content by replacing half the butter (well, I made a vegan version so dairy-free margarine) with applesauce.  Instead of the egg I used 1.5tsp egg replacer powder mixed with 2tbs water and I also added 0.5tsp baking powder.</p>
<p>The blondies stuck to the pan quite badly but I&#8217;m not sure if this is because of the high sugar content, reduced fat content or because I left them to get cold before cutting them out.  No matter, I&#8217;m definitely going to make them again!  They look just like the photos and taste awesome.</p>

				<p>I made these last night, adding chopped dates and walnuts. Although absolutely delicious, they were super gooey in the middle but also cracked and crumbled on the outside&#8230; any ideas what could have gone wrong? I baked them for 30 minutes and took them out when they were nicely browned on top&#8230;</p>

				<p>Deb, these are in the oven as I type this; just popped them in not thirty seconds ago. If the batter is anything to go by, these are going to be divine.</p>
<p>Hannah, I&#8217;m no expert by far, but did you preheat the oven first? I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re supposed to. Also check that your oven&#8217;s temperature is even and correct.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the recipe, they are really yummy! My problem was that I baked them close to 45 minutes  and they were still super gooey in the middle- like inedible- but the outside ones were great! I ony put about 1/2 cup M&amp;Ms and used the 8&#215;8 pan, could it be because I used a glass pan?  Any ideas?</p>

				<p>Heee heee!! Hey Ann, I made these with mashed banana, toasted walnuts, and bittersweet choc. chips last night!!  Sounded sooo good, and they were absolutely delicious.  I usually do not care for banana and walnuts, but loved it in the blondies.  My boyfriend called them Chunky Monkey blondies!!  </p>
<p>I doubled the recipe, and baked them in a 9&#215;13 Pyrex glass dish.  I thought I might have to bake them longer than 25 min., but they were PERFECT once baked for that amount of time.  Everybody loved them! Thanks for sharing, Deb!</p>

				<p>My 14 year-old daughter made these and they are absolutely yummy!  SO EASY!  She doubled the recipe (soooo very necessary) and did half with only butterscotch chips and half with both butterscotch and chocolate chips.  Oh, how I wish that kid liked nuts because a coupla toasted pecans would be so very tasty in these!  I was a bit concerned that there was no powder/soda in the recipe but they turned out moist and wonderful.  I could see that these would be fabulous with coconut, corn flakes, tiny salted pretzel rods (I&#8217;m with you, Deb: Salty + sweet is my favorite!) or whatever one felt the compulsion to add.  We REALLY buttered the metal 9&#215;13&#8243; pan and had NO problem with sticking.  We WILL, however, have a problem sticking to the any New Year&#8217;s resolutions after finding this recipe. A keeper!!  Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>Oh man. What&#8217;s killer here is those unforgettable measurements.  By which I mean, I will be able to remember those whenever I might have a craving for something gooey and sweet.  Which is bad.</p>
<p>I forgot my 8&#215;8 is in the freezer with a casserole, so baked them in a round cake pan with no problems.  It was non-stick so I actually turned the whole thing out onto a plastic tray, then just carefully flipped it back over (so I could avoid cutting them on the non-stick surface).</p>
<p>We put in toasted walnuts, choco chips, almond extract, a tablespoon of instant coffee, and about 2-3 tablespoons of brandy.  Amazing&#8230;</p>

				<p>Checking in again. I made a half batch this time and the butter was melted before I realized all my eggs were hard-boiled.  I spent 5 minutes researching complicated egg substitutions before just dumping a tiny pile of baking soda in with my half-cup of flour.  Oh, and I forgot to time them in the oven.  So we&#8217;re not talking about the texture here (ok, we are: when warm, goop, when cold, concrete).</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re talking about is the taste.  This round&#8217;s add-ins were<br />
raisins<br />
chocolate chips<br />
vanilla<br />
a touch of cognac<br />
cinnamon<br />
and heavy-handed cardamom.</p>
<p>Amazing++</p>

				<p>This is my go-to recipe, especially because regular brownies always have so much granulated sugar, and brown sugar is just so much more interesting and complex. I also always dump in those peanut butter filled pretzel nuggets and big chocolate chunks &#8211; feves if I have them, but Nestle chunks work too! It&#8217;s the perfect combo of salty and sweet.</p>

				<p>Oh lord! I just made these and they are SO GOOD!  I added half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and a quarter cup of toasted, chopped hazelnuts. Next time I might add a splash of Kahlua. I can also imagine these tasting yummy with walnuts and mushed up banana, kind of like a twist on banana nut bread.</p>

				<p>Just baked these- they are still in the oven but I&#8217;m having the same problem as some others here- gooey centre.  Perhaps it&#8217;sbecause of the bakingware you are using- I used glass and it was gooey.  A quick online search tells me to lower the temp by 25F and bake longer.</p>

				<p>Mmm just made these.<br />
Peanut butter, mixed nuts, milk chocolate, roasted sunflower seeds? To die for. Baked in a glass pan, I always lower the temp of everything in a fear of ACTUAL BROWNING (oh no) and left it in there about five, ten minutes longer, and they came out slightly gooey and utterly delicious&#8211;just the way i like it.<br />
I like Heather&#8217;s idea of white chips. Only if I had had some..</p>

				<p>I selected this recipe as my baking project for Thursday Treat Day at work. Upon searching my cabinets I discovered that I didn&#8217;t have an 8&#215;8 pan.</p>
<p>Solution: mini blondie bites. I filled greased baby muffin tins 3/4 full with the chocolate chip dotted batter and baked 14-16 minutes. They came out great. There isn&#8217;t as much chewy middle because of their smallness, but they are so cute and yummy!</p>

				<p>Hey Deb!<br />
Huge fan. I waste many a hours hitting surprise me on your site everyday! I&#8217;m so happy i came upon this the other day. My roommate and I just made these as a pick me up&#8230;I&#8217;ve been talking about the recipe non stop because its so easy! Ok so we added a few things&#8230; a whole mashed banana, marshmellows, chocolate chips, and lil bit o baileys (hey, school&#8217;s almost out for summer!).<br />
The thing is, they turned out a bit dense. Like &#8220;a rich flan&#8221; my roommate says haha.<br />
Any tips?? :-)</p>

				<p>Joy of Cooking has you brown the butter (and I know how you feel about browning the butter&#8230;).  Although you need to cool it a bit after browning before adding sugar, or else you get caramel and the blondies are still delish but really sticky.</p>

				<p>I wonder, if you doubled these but made them in the same pan, would they cook properly, or would they never get done until the edges were toast?  They&#8217;re tasty, but they&#8217;ll look funny on a plate next to my brownies, &#8217;cause the brownies are so much taller.  Or should I maybe leaven these somehow to get a taller blondie?</p>
<p>I do like the flavor, though (mine are half chocolate chips, half walnuts, pretty traditional), and I REALLY like the simple recipe &#8212; one of these, one of those, cup of this, cup of that, so simple!</p>

				<p>I have made these several times, and they always come out great. I&#8217;ve gotten used to doubling them, because everyone likes them so much! I just followed Deb&#8217;s advice- and started checking them after 30 minutes&#8230; I like them super gooey so I tend to underbake them a little! My go-to add ins are Ghirardelli chocolate chips (usually a combination of white and either semisweet or bittersweet), almond extract, and sometimes chopped walnuts. After viewing Nicole&#8217;s comment about browning the butter (lady, I like the way you think!), I am definitely going to do that next time. This is like the lovechild of a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie, and it&#8217;s oh so good!</p>

				<p>Made these bad boys TWICE last night. My cheap baking tin was peeling (don’t wanna really know why/how/what) so covered it in baking paper/melted butter. The first batch stuck to the paper (nearly removed appendage furiously using paring knife trying to dig paper off &#8211; I was so close yet so far…) so used foil for the second batch. Result? Blondies in my tummy for the first time (well, blondies without paper&#8230;)<br />
I used SimplyRecipes’ proportions of baking powder/soda in second batch (experimentation hat was firmly on) and I guess if that’s the way you like them, go for it! Any way you like em, the moment was magical and I’m stopping myself from ending this post any other way in case it sounds too dirty…<br />
PS ta for great browned butter/peanut butter ideas above</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve tried the Lemon Tart, Coffee Cake and I just tried this recipe last night! Smitten Kitchen never dissapoints! I think I overdid the time in the oven since everytime I checked on it I thought the middle was still too raw, but besides the extra crispy crust it was delicious! I added a handfull of walnuts and chocolate chips. Also, I didn&#8217;t know if I should use the vanilla extract or the almond, so I used a little of both and it was amazing! I have never used almond extract and the flavor is really intense! Thanks!!</p>

				<p>Fantastic! I made them with macadamia nuts, dried cherries and white chocolate chips.</p>
<p>A question: Do you think they would freeze well? I&#8217;d like to bring some on a family vacation and won&#8217;t have time to bake the night before (although the recipe is incredibly easy).</p>

				<p>Once I saw this post, I became obsessed with the idea of bananas and chocolate chips in these blondies.  I used 1 cup of bittersweet chips, and 1/2 cup of mashed banana.  I was a little surprised (perhaps naively) at how strongly (but nicely!) the banana came through.  It made them very moist and light.  If I make them again&#8211;let&#8217;s be honest, WHEN I make them again&#8211;I&#8217;ll probably scale back the banana a tiny bit&#8230;and even the chocolate chips!  There were just so many; I think 3/4 of a cup would do just as nicely.  Thanks so much for this recipe!</p>

				<p>I had 1 hour before I had to be at a bbq, dessert in hand. These babies saved me, topped with a quick peanut butter glaze. They were the first thing to be entirely devoured.</p>
<p>Next time I would like to try &amp; add the peanut butter into the batter but because I was so short on time I was too scared I&#8217;d ruin them &amp; be dessert-less. Anyone have any ideas on how much to add or what to scale back on?</p>

				<p>I was craving a dessert, but wanted a recipe that was fast and utilized ingredient that I already had.  So these were perfect. I toasted about a 1/2 cup of pecans and a half cup of sweetened shredded coconut and added that with almond extract (in place of vanilla).  They were yummy and goodey with a little crunch from the coconut and pecans.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I made a double batch of these for our friends last night and converted the recipe to gluten free by substituting 2 cups of Perfect Blend Gluten Free flour and 1/2 tsp. xanthum gum for the regular flour.  (Two friends have Celiac Disease.)  They were a hit with everyone!</p>

				<p>thank you so much for this recipe!  i am wheat intolerant (but can eat gluten) so i subbed in an equal measure of white spelt flour for the AP flour and added 1/4 tsp of baking soda (spelt doesn&#8217;t like to rise much)- and they turned out great!</p>

				<p>This is a great recipe and fun to make! I tried this today with dark brown sugar instead because I had no brown sugar and it tasted a bit too sweet in the end. Maybe next time I&#8217;ll use brown sugar, and more added ingredients to stifle the sweet taste? </p>

				<p>im really puzzled, deb help me out here please!</p>
<p>i halved the recipe but added 2T strong boiled espresso AFTER mixing the flour and choc chips in to the egg/butter/sugar mixture. the final mixture separated!!!</p>
<p>why did that happen? should i have added in the espresso liquid together with the flour and not after i had already mixed everything? </p>
<p>during baking, the butter literally OOZED out of the batter and i had to use tissue paper to blot it. im estimating almost 1T of butter oozed out. it was, quite frankly, disgusting.</p>
<p>what did i do wrong?!</p>

				<p>Browned the butter. Toasted the pecans. Tripled the vanilla. And went with semisweet chocolate chips. They&#8217;re in the oven right now. The batter was OH SO GOOD. I can hardly wait for them to be done baking. Yep :)</p>

				<p>LOVED this recipe! I had everything in my pantry, which is absolutely fantastic when you are a college student, and was able to use leftover chocolate chips and toffee bits I had lying around from previous recipes. They were a hit! I baked them for about 30 min though and they came out perfect. I love that you gave a base recipe that we can just work off of, great way to spark some creativity!</p>

				<p>With my sweet tooth screaming, i got online to find a recipe to make something out of my only ingredients- brown sugar, eggs and flour.. This was so the perfect find. I swirled in 4 big globs of peanut butter and threw in a handful of callebaut semi sweet chips i had leftover (from god knows when) and they totally hit the spot. Thanks again :)</p>

				<p>My go-to blondie recipe is Marcy Goldman&#8217;s. They&#8217;re a lot like these but while they&#8217;re in the pan you scoop dulce du leche into them and kind of bury it under the batter. When you eat them you get a little pool of dulce de leche. Delicious!!! I also add milk chocolate chips. I thought you&#8217;d like the dulce de leche suggestion Deb- I think you mentioned that you kind of like the stuff. It&#8217;s a good strong dulce de leche taste too. Gotta love Marcy Goldman!</p>

				<p>This is a winner!  I made them just as described and added 1/2 cup chocolate chunks and 1/2 cup pecans.  My teenage boys just loved them.  I made the recipe in an 8X8 glass pan baked them for 22 minutes and they came out perfectly.  (I also cut a square of parchment paper and put it in the bottom of the dish and buttered the sides)  No sticking here, then I cut them into 16 squares.  Thanks so much!

				<p>I do have one question that I didn&#8217;t find through your posts&#8211;</p>
<p>The first time I made these they were perfect, but the last two batches came out too cake like. Could it be because I used an electric beater to mix the butter&amp;brown sugar? I&#8217;m not sure If I did otherwise the first time!</p>

				<p>okay. reporting back in! I made these last night and they were FANTASTIC! I put in the 1/4 cup of bourbon (Woodford Reserve), 3/4 cup of dark chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of pecans (didn&#8217;t toast them first). the bourbon taste was not too strong, just a hint of it, and the overall taste was incredible. took them to my boyfriend&#8217;s house and he loved them, too. I did extend the baking time by 10 minutes, to 35 minutes total. used an 8 x 8 aluminum baking pan. they were still a little gooey in the middle, just perfect. yummy stuff! next time I&#8217;m trying with dried cranberries and pistachios for a Christmasy look.</p>

				<p>Another winner from Smitten!  I&#8217;ve been going through the archives and been meaning to try these, so I made them this morning to bring to work for our last day before Christmas.  I made them with premium Guitard dark chocolate chips and toasted pecans, and used KA white whole wheat flour and vanilla bean paste instead of extract, and they are to die for!  I can&#8217;t believe they are this easy and this good.  This one goes with your chocolate chip sour cream coffee cake as one of my go-to recipes. Thank you!</p>

				<p>Just wanted to say what an amazingly TASTY Blondie recipe this is! They turned out just like the picture, moist and buttery and full of flavor. I decided to use dark brown sugar, and I really think it added a nice touch to the flavor. I made two batches together and added a generously overfilled cup of semi-sweet chocolate chunks, then divided it into two bowls, adding 1/2 cup butterscotch chips to one, and 1/2 cup mixed fruit bits in the other. Finally, to give it a bit &#8216;more&#8217;, I added another splash of vanilla. Baked both kinds in 2 8&#215;8 pans, for about 25 minutes. Everyone was dying to try a piece because the whole house smelled delish and couldn&#8217;t hardly wait for it to cool off :D I made several treats to give to friends and family in tins in one night (haha it was a baking war-zone in the kitchen last night), and I was so relieved how easy and simple this recipe was. I will be using this recipe and customizing it in every way possible. Next time, I want to try bourbon or rum with coconut and cashews! Both kinds are great in their own way, the butterscotch chips were to die for, and the mixed fruit bits add a really pleasant tangy texture :D Happy Holidays!! &amp; Thank You!!</p>

				<p>I have made these twice now: first with bourbon, pecans and chocolate chips and then with espresso powder and chocolate chips. Both variations were really tasty! Next up, I am going to bake them with dried cranberries or cherries. Thanks for another hit recipe!</p>

				<p>&#8217;til now I&#8217;d only encountered blondies as raised (not dense and gooey), dried-out crusty things.  This recipe changed that&#8211;they&#8217;re awesome.  Thank you!</p>

				<p>These are probably my most universally adored dessert.  And they take about 5 minutes to make (I usually mix everything in the baking dish so there is literally no cleanup).  I toss in whatever I find in the pantry, but my personal fav is chocolate and macadamia nuts.</p>

				<p>Thank you so very much for a wonderful blondie recipe.  I modified this recipe a bit by cutting down the fat and adding bananas and pecans.  THey were SUPERB!  You are a genius!  I mentioned you in my blog &#8211; I really love your work.  :-)  I hope you take a look when you have a minute.  <a href="http://www.honeywhatscooking.com/2011/01/gooey-delicious-banana-blondies-reduced.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.honeywhatscooking.com/2011/01/gooey-delicious-banana-blondies-reduced.html</a></p>

				<p>These turned out great! And yes. They really are better after an overnight set (I know, because I had some for dessert last night and &#8220;breakfast&#8221; this morning). Definitely save one or two so you can taste the difference.</p>

				<p>These are HEAVENLY over the holidays with a little cinnamon, nuts, and fresh cranberries.  Dried would work, but I think the fresh really made them look and taste great.  I meant to add nutmeg and forgot.  Will have to try next time. Thanks for posting!</p>

				<p>I figured out the &#8220;melting the butter &amp; then mixing the sugar together&#8221; technique some 15 years ago when was in my first NYC apartment &amp; I didn&#8217;t have a beater. I only had a whisk and the idea of trying to do it by hand&#8230; ugh! It really was an act of desperation, but it turned out to be the best possible technique for making chewy cookies of every ilk! Chocolate chip, oatmeal, molasses gingersnaps, lemon, sugar &#8211; you name it. If you like a thinner, chewier cookie, then this is the best and easiest way to get it. If you like a crisp cookie, then just let it cook all the way through. If you like a dense and sensuous bar cookie or brownie, then this is your hook. It truly was a revelation! Later on when I worked with a pastry chef in a 3 star restaurant, I saw her doing the same thing, and smiled to myself for my ingenuity.</p>

				<p>The bars are awesome. They almost taste like you&#8217;re eating cookie dough. And I totally agree with some of the comments about how good they taste on day 2. I&#8217;m eating one now. The flavor is richer today. And the macadamia nuts are heaven!</p>

				<p>Terrific!<br />
I made the doubled recipe, baked in a 9&#215;13 metal pan lined with buttered foil so I could lift them out easily. Browned the butter, used dark brown sugar. Added 1 cup toasted chopped almonds(oh, no, I&#8217;m out of pecans!!) and about 3/4 cup dried sour cherries. Forgot to mix in the teeny semi-sweet choc chips I had intended, so I scattered about 3/4 cup over half with about 5 minutes to go, about 30 minutes total. Then somewhat inelegantly spread the melty chocolate over half the pan. Yummy!</p>
<p>Next will be a pan of brownies with orange zest and orange chocolate chunks&#8230;</p>

				<p>Deb &#8212; This recipe is my favorite.  I have made them countless times for last-minute events.  I can throw them together in less than 5 minutes with any add-in I have around, and they are so, so, good!  Cannot wait for your cookbook.   Thanks so much.</p>

				<p>I have made these so many times I can&#8217;t count.  Just made them again for my kids. Doubled the recipe and made them in a 9&#215;13 pan. Added m&amp;m&#8217;s and milk duds to use up Halloween candy I had lurking in the freezer!  They were a huge hit yet again. Thanks!</p>

				<p>I thought these looked delicious and based on all the comments I was pretty sure they would be, but given the fact that I&#8217;m in Europe (and our oven is slightly off) they came out really thin and more like caramel squares than the thicker blondies I love. Granted, I didn&#8217;t double the recipe and used an 8 x 10 pan but still! Was dissappointed. And I didn&#8217;t scrimp on mixtures either (used chocolate chunks, walnuts and a half of a banana, mashed) I&#8217;m wondering if maybe my conversions were off&#8230;can anyone recommend a good US/Metric conversion website? I&#8217;m living in France and they do have great patisseries but they sure don&#8217;t know how to diversify and I miss all of my American faves. thanks everyone!</p>

				<p>FYI, do not add an entire bag of choco chips.  There is, apparently, such as thing as too much chocolate.</p>
<p>Also, my baking time was practically double what you suggested.  I used a circular metal cake pan and was pleased that it popped right out afterwards for wedge serving.  How could it not though with all that butter?</p>

				<p>I made these this weekend for a family party, and they were a hit! I doubled the recipe and  stirred in about 3/4 of a cup of natural chunky peanut butter. I also sprinkled chocolate chips over about half of the pan before baking&#8211;we have chocolate-averse in our family, and this was an easy way to make two kinds of treat in one pan. I especially like the crispy corner pieces.</p>

				<p>Made these last night, and they were absolutely wonderful.  I added a 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, and found the combination of sweet and tart with the chewing blondie background fantastic.</p>
<p>I did add to the baking time a bit, as the middle seemed far to soft.  I started checking at 20 min, and they came out at probably 35.  Ended up still being gooey, but with crispy outsides.  Perfect!</p>
<p>Fairly new to Smitten Kitchen, but thanks for everything Deb.  I&#8217;ll keep cooking with you, for sure&#8230;</p>

				<p>Hi, I want to make these for a bake sale but I have a few questions because i don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll have a chance to test them out first&#8230;<br />
all i have is whole wheat flour, would that change the texture or taste too much? what about adding peanut butter? and for a 9&#215;13 pan, do I need to change the proportions significantly or does it not make too much of a difference? sorry for the bombardment!</p>
