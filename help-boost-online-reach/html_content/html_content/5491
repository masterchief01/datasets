										<p>Regardless of the online communities in which you choose to participate, the connected, communal nature of Web 2.0 has transformed the Internet itself into one big social network. In creating online profiles, commenting on blogs, posting photos and replying to message boards you have created a rich online database of yourself and your life experiences. This participation takes place within the familiar, open and ultimately human community of the internet, with people who share or have something to say about your thoughts and beliefs, and that interaction is so valuable and relevant because on the other side of that technological platform is a person.</p>
										<p>So is that interaction just as valuable if it is based on the things someone used to think and believe? However, just because that person has passed away physically, does that make their comments, or indeed their lives, any less valuable or any less relevant? At the same time, if you died would you want your 2007 uni self or your 2009 backpacking self speaking for you in the future?</p>

										<p>A physical will covers your wishes for your physical self as well as your physical assets after your death. But what about your digital life? Now that we live almost as much online as we do in the physical world we need to have a plan for managing our digital deaths too. In order to carry out your digital death plan you will need to create a digital will, as well as select a trustworthy digital executor to handle arrangements for your digital assets and digital legacy once you are gone.

										Eva's blog grew enormously in popularity and just over a month before her death she posted her final video telling her friends and followers 'My life is ending'.</p>
										<p>While Eva didn't leave a message for her family to post on her blog after her death, her parents have continued to post on her page to keep all of her

										<p>A person who goes through their life without questioning their thoughts and actions and without allowing others to do the same is not learning or experiencing anything new and therefore is not really living. How is it that we know about this insightful philosophy? Because over two and a half thousand years ago someone thought to record the musings of a man named Socrates, but more amazingly, during the last two and a half thousand years someone else has decided to keep that record alive. </p>

										<p>Creating a digital representation of our physical selves sees us all living a highly examined life. As we post our thoughts and questions to elicit response and discussion from friends and family we are also able to look back on the things we've said and done in the past in crisp digital clarity. </p>

										<p>Our lives will always be examined, as we use lessons from the past to succeed in the future. Archaeologists will still gather the same information about our diets, relationships, social interactions and pastimes. However, digital archaeologists will be swapping their picks and brushes for data files and coding, and instead of struggling to piece together tiny scrap of artefacts, they will have more information and more detail than ever before <sup>[8]</sup>.  </p>

									<div class="image-desc">
										<p>Studies of human behaviour and human history are just as interested in day to day life and interactions as they are in the turning point moments of each generation. However, just because all of the seemingly mundane information about everyone's everyday lives permeates every facet of our lives now, it may not be around forever. Instead, digital records should be treated like an oral history, recognising the fleeting and fragile nature of the information, and the fluidity of the medium</p>
										<p>Whilst archaeologists are in danger of being overwhelmed by the volume of data we are all creating every second of the day, and in 100 or 1,000 years, how will they know what information is important to our cultural heritage? Unless...our digital selves were there to tell them...?</p>

									<div class="image-desc">
										<p>In order to draw meaningful conclusions from the information our digital selves are leaving behind, archaeologists will be looking at online text such as comments, status updates and blog posts. However, much of this information is left anonymously, or under an alias, and to make connections around these contributions archaeologists may use write prints. Write prints look at the vocabulary, the length of sentences, the words and punctuation patterns and common grammatical errors commonly used by each writer to make connections between writing all over the Internet <sup>[9]</sup>.  Therefore, even though you may think you are posting anonymously, by using write prints digital archaeologists may have the ability to detect and make connections across a range of digital media. </p>

										<p>Under a contract with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the National Library of Australia developed Guidelines for the Preservation of Digital Heritage in 2003 and has been collecting historic online publications relating to Australia and Australians since 1996 as part of the <a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/" target="_blank">Pandora Archive</a> <sup>[10]</sup>.</p>
										<p>As part of the Copyright Act 1968, the National Library requires publishers to include one copy of each edition of a work in the library. Most states around Australia also have this requirement, but it has not yet been extended to include copies of electronic publications. Unfortunately the vast amount of information published online has meant that the job of deciding which digital publications are worth preserving in the Pandora archive is a job which is just currently too big.</p>

									<div class="image-desc">
										<p>The Internet is such a valuable tool because it is always changing, updating and evolving. However, if we all decided we wanted our digital selves to live forever, the Internet would be in danger of being filled with more information from the dead than from the living. Therefore, just as old letters fade and old photos are moved from the mantelpiece to a box under the bed, perhaps our digital selves should be allowed to grow old gradually too.</p>
										<p>Building in a mechanism to allow us to digitally forget gracefully was the suggestion of Mayer-Schönberger in his book 'Delete', where he proposed that files should come with expiry dates so they would simply vanish or 'digitally rust' after a certain amount of time, unless we made a conscious effort to preserve them <sup>[11]</sup>. Several companies are taking up these ideas, for example a German business called <a href="http://www.x-pire.de/index.php?id=6&L=2" target="_blank">X-Pire</a> allows you to add an expiry date to images you've uploaded to sites like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=deceased" title="Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
										<p>It may not even be your family who keeps the rust off of your digital self; as the nature of the Internet has proven, when there is something truly exceptional to see, it is repeatedly saved and shared, so ideally the best contributions to the community of the Internet will be kept alive by the community itself.</p>

				<h3>Digital waste is destroying the environment</h3>
				<p>Learning about digital wills, digital executors and digital undertakers is an important step in the digital age, however, very few people are even aware of the issues. Because there is neither a uniform approach nor clearly defined policy to dealing with deceased online estates <sup>[12]</sup> and we never know when death might strike, it is your responsibility to start cleaning up your act online now.</p>
				<p>Consider whether you ever read your university alumni email newsletter now that you are subscribed to more relevant industry news.  Are you still receiving updates from wedding websites now that you're married? And the big one - take a long hard look at your emails. Which ones will you ever read again? Seriously.</p>

			<p>What would your digital legacy be like if you died tomorrow? The fact is, none of us really knows what happens to our spiritual self when we die, but whether you believe you'll be looking down on your loved ones from a better place, or there really is nothing for you after your last status update, your digital self is already out there, in the cloud, more far reaching and powerful than you could have ever imagined. Therefore take the opportunity to decide now, whether who you are online is really who you are in life, and if this is how you want to be remembered.</p>
			<p>As confronting as it is to think about the afterlife, or simply what happens after life, a well lived life is one from which you will be missed. Therefore if there are friends or family you will leave behind when you die wouldn't it be nice to know you'll be able to touch their lives in a positive way after you're gone, and that your digital legacy has been preserved as the valuable social, historical and archaeological artefact that it is? That we all are?</p>
			<p>Therefore, use the resources below to find out more about the issues surrounding digital death, how those issues will change and affect you into the future. You will also find listed below websites which can help you decide whether you do want your digital self to live forever and if so in what form. Once you've made these decisions you can start making arrangements to prepare for your digital death or afterlife.</p>
