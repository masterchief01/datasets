<p class="vl">The following letters have been edited for length and some names have been changed.</p>

<p class="vl">October 23, 1990<br>
 Mr. William Falk<br>
 News Director<br>
 KCLU-TV</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mr. Falk &mdash;</p>

<p class="vl">I have just watched your Ten O'Clock News for this evening and I thought I would take you up on your offer, generously made at the
close of the broadcast, to write to you if I had a question on your news program.</p>

<p class="vl">At the close of your "Entertainment News" section, your anchor-person said &mdash; and I am here paraphrasing but the numbers are exact
&mdash; "A new survey says that the average American child will view over twenty million television commercials by the time he or she is sixty-five
years old."</p>

<p class="vl">This is a shocking statistic &mdash; so shocking that I just had to get out my little calculator and do the math on this.&nbsp; The way
I figure it, if a child starts watching immediately upon birth &mdash; straight out of the womb &mdash; that child would have to see 307,692
commercials (give or take a station break) per year to have viewed twenty million by the close of his/her sixty-fifth year.</p>

<p class="vl">307,692 commercials works out to almost 843 commercials per day.&nbsp; This is an awful lot of commercials.&nbsp; Let us assume, for
the sake of argument, that our "average child" has no need for sleep, no need for schooling and is so wealthy as to never need to leave the TV in
order to go to work.&nbsp; Our "average child" is therefore able to watch TV for twenty-four hours a day, every day of the year for sixty-five years
and never watches cable or public television.&nbsp; This still works out to about thirty-five commercials per hour.</p>

<p class="vl">Even with deregulation, I do not believe the F.C.C. allows any TV station to broadcast thirty-five commercials per hour.&nbsp; In the
hour following your news program, your station broadcast (I counted) twenty commercials.</p>

<p class="vl">My first question is how any of this is possible.&nbsp; My second question is where you found this survey.&nbsp; And I guess my third
and fourth questions are whether anyone in your newsroom has a calculator and if anyone thought the "twenty million" figure might have sounded a wee
bit high.</p>

<p class="vl">Puzzled by it all,<br>
 Mark Evanier</p>

 Los Angeles, CA</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mr. Evanier,</p>

<p class="vl">Thank you for your recent communique regarding our "News at Ten."&nbsp; I can assure you that our staff thoroughly researched the
matter in question and that we stand by the efforts of our staff.&nbsp; Should the item in question subsequently prove to warrant it, additional
information and clarification will be broadcast.</p>

<p class="vl">We appreciate your interest and trust that you will continue as a steady viewer of "News at Ten."</p>

<p class="vl">Very Truly Yours,<br>

<p class="vl">November 2, 1990<br>
 Mr. William Falk<br>
 News Director<br>
 WCLU-TV</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mr. Falk &mdash;</p>

<p class="vl">Thank you for your letter about my letter but I'm afraid that your letter did not address the central point of my letter.</p>

<p class="vl">Since you're doubtlessly a busy man, I'll refresh your memory.&nbsp; On your broadcast of 10/23/90, you broadcast a news item claiming
that, by the time he or she is sixty-five, the Average American child will have viewed twenty million commercials.</p>

<p class="vl">I did the math on this "statistic" and discovered that it divides out to over 800 commercials watched a day.&nbsp; I suggested that
common sense would tell us that it is physically impossible for anyone to watch 800 commercials per day.&nbsp; If you watched TV steadily for ten
hours a day &mdash; which would be a lot &mdash; you would see approximately 200 commercials.</p>

<p class="vl">My question is where you got this statistic and whether you really believed it is true.</p>

<p class="vl">Repetitively,<br>
 Mark Evanier</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mr. Evanier,</p>

<p class="vl">My apologies for the delay in answering yours of 11/2 but we are shorthanded here and I was out with a bout of the flu for a time.</p>

<p class="vl">I have referred your query to the researcher who handled that particular segment.&nbsp; You will be hearing directly from him
shortly.</p>

<p class="vl">Thank you again for your interest and we look forward to your continued viewing of "News at Ten."</p>

<p class="vl">Very Truly Yours,</p>

<p class="vl">January 10, 1991<br>
 Bill Falk<br>
 News Director<br>
 KCLU-TV</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Bill &mdash;</p>

<p class="vl">Remember me?&nbsp; I'm the pain-in-the derriere who wrote you a couple letters last year about a "statistic" of dubious accuracy that
you broadcast on "News at Ten" back then.</p>

<p class="vl">Your news anchor reported that, by the time he or she is sixty-five, the Average American child will view twenty million TV
commercials.&nbsp; I wrote, asking what the source of this figure was and also pointing out that this number was ridiculous.&nbsp; You said that a
researcher would be in touch to explain the source of this statistic but, so far, I have heard nothing.&nbsp; I realize that the holidays mess up
everyone's schedule but,as a working professional in the TV industry, I am genuinely interested in this statistic and would like to uncover its
source and substantiation.</p>

<p class="vl">While I've got you here: According to the <i>1990 Information Please Almanac,</i> issued by Houghton-Mifflin, page 744, the Average
American over the age of two watches a little under thirty hours of television a week.&nbsp; Assuming this Average American doesn't watch cable or
public broadcasting, he or she would have to see 197 commercials per hour in those thirty hours in order to see twenty million by age sixty-five.</p>

<p class="vl">Doesn't anything about the statistic you broadcast sound a little bizarre to you?</p>

<p class="vl">Not Giving Up,<br>
 Mark Evanier</p>

 Mark Evanier<br>
 Los Angeles, CA</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mr. Evanier,</p>

<p class="vl">William Falk asked me to write to you in reference to your letter regarding a news item we broadcast last October.&nbsp; If I am
informed correctly, the item dealt with the average number of commercials viewed by an individual in this country.</p>

<p class="vl">Our source for the story in question was United Press International so if the facts, as stated, were not correct, it is their error and
not ours.</p>

<p class="vl">All of us here in the newsroom appreciate your interest and if I can be of further help, please drop me a line.</p>

<p class="vl">January 31, 1991<br>
 Mr. William Falk<br>
 News Director<br>
 KCLU-TV</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Billy &mdash;</p>

<p class="vl">(And I hope I can call you Billy after all we've been through...)</p>

<p class="vl">I am enclosing a Xerox of a letter that I received yesterday from the researcher you promised would write to me.&nbsp; I appreciate the
letter but I am a bit puzzled how I could receive, on January 31st, a letter dated February 1.&nbsp; I know you advertise, "Today's news, today" but
do you also handle, "Tomorrow's mail, yesterday"?</p>

<p class="vl">No matter.&nbsp; Of far more concern to me is the policy, implied in the attached letter, that you and your fine news organization
assume no responsibility for the accuracy of the news you broadcast.&nbsp; Is this so?&nbsp; Please, Bill, ol' pal, tell me it isn't so.</p>

<p class="vl">Still writing these letters,<br>
 Mark</p>

<p class="vl">P.S. One other thing.&nbsp; Last week, due to sports, your "News at Ten" seemed to commence most evenings after eleven o'clock.&nbsp; I
see that you also replay the entire broadcast every day at around three in the morning.&nbsp; This means that most recent airings of "News at Ten"
have not been at ten.&nbsp; Knowing the trouble your organization seems to have with numbers, I thought I ought to call this to your attention.</p>

 Mark Evanier<br>
 Los Angeles, CA</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mr. Evanier,</p>

<p class="vl">Mr. Falk ("Billy" to you) requested that I handle your most recent inquiry.</p>

<p class="vl">He asked that I assure you that our organization stands behind its news broadcasts.&nbsp; We have assembled what we believe to be one
of the finest news-gathering teams in local television, as witness the six local Emmy Awards that have been bestowed on our organization over the
last three years.&nbsp; We furthermore employ the services of United Press International, Associated Press, Cable News Network and other recognized
news services, all in an effort too present the timeliest, most informative news broadcast in Los Angeles.</p>

<p class="vl">We are looking into the matter you inquired about but, while our researchers look into it, I wanted to assure you that we do, indeed,
stand behind the contents of every "News at Ten" broadcast.</p>

<p class="vl">Cordially,<br>
 Elizabeth Holtzman<br>
 Assistant to Mr. Falk</p>

 Elizabeth Holtzman<br>
 Assistant to Mr. Falk<br>
 KCLU-TV</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Ms. Holtzman...</p>

<p class="vl">Thank you for your letter.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you about the matter that caused me to write in the first place.</p>

<p class="vl">Just so we're in synch: I wrote, inquiring about the source of an alleged news item broadcast last October on your news program.&nbsp;
It stated that the average child, by age sixty-five, will view "over twenty million commercials."&nbsp; I wrote to point out that this works out to a
little less than two hundred commercials viewed per hour...and, of course, no TV show &mdash; not even the Home Shopping Network in all its glory
&mdash; broadcasts two hundred commercials per hour.</p>

<p class="vl">I didn't mean for this to go on as long as it has.&nbsp; I just wanted to know where you got this "statistic" and to suggest that, just
maybe, you had broadcast something that wasn't true.</p>

<p class="vl">I look forward to hearing from you on whether your fine staff &mdash; and I'm sure they are fine &mdash; really believes this.</p>

<p class="vl">Thanks...<br>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images1/1blackpixel20.gif" width="70%" height="20"></p>

<p class="vl">June 4, 1991<br>
 Mr. William Falk<br>
 News Director<br>
 KCLU-TV</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mr. Falk...</p>

<p class="vl">Let us review.</p>

<p class="vl">Last October, your station broadcast an alleged news item that the average American will view twenty million commercials before they
reach age 65.&nbsp; I wrote to you, suggesting that this statistic was absurd.</p>

<p class="vl">You were nice enough to answer my inquiry and I have since exchanged no small number of letters with you, as well as Ms. Holtzman and
Mr. Willson, both of your staff.&nbsp; Ms. Holtzman assured me that your organization does indeed stand behind the "news items" it broadcasts, while
Mr. Willson told me in one letter that the item came from United Press International and, in another letter, that it came from the Associated
Press.&nbsp; No one has yet, however, explained how it is possible to watch TV and to see two hundred commercials per hour, which is what the "twenty
million" figure averages down to.</p>

<p class="vl">I suspect that your staff has no idea as to the source of this supposed statistic.&nbsp; And I further suspect that you don't believe
it is true.</p>

<p class="vl">Moreover, with enormous presumption here, I suspect that you, as a responsible news organization, receive a great number of crackpot
complaints from viewers who are mad about something that has been accurately reported on the news.&nbsp; Rather than accept the truth, the crackpots
blame you and impugn your accuracy and honesty.&nbsp; As a result, you have developed a tendency to dismiss letters of complaint as the product of
fanatical, stubborn minds.&nbsp; You are polite to these people, while admitting nothing, because they're never going to believe the truth.</p>

<p class="vl">Lastly, I suspect that when a legitimate inquiry, such as mine, comes across your desk you automatically give it "the treatment."</p>

<p class="vl">I asked you a very simple, factual question with no insinuation that you were slanting or phonying up the news in order to pursue some
selfish, devious personal agenda.&nbsp; How about taking note of that and giving me a direct reply?</p>

<p class="vl">This is probably my last letter on the subject.</p>

<p class="vl">Giving up...<br>
 Mark</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images1/1blackpixel20.gif" width="70%" height="20"></p>

<p class="vl">July 22, 1991<br>
 Mark Evanier<br>
 Los Angeles, CA</p>

<p class="vl">Dear Mark,</p>

<p class="vl">You're right.&nbsp; We screwed up.&nbsp; Actually, we screwed up several times in several ways, commencing with the original
broadcast.&nbsp; Then we screwed up in how we handled your most reasonable inquiry.</p>

<p class="vl">Obviously, the commercials statistic is in error.&nbsp; Given the amount of time that has passed, I do not know if we shall broadcast a
retraction but we probably should.</p>

<p class="vl">And you are completely correct that our mail usually takes us to task for not reporting the news the way the letter writer feels it
should be reported.&nbsp; You would be astounded at the extreme political beliefs, covering the entire spectrum of politics, we have been accused of
secretly advancing.</p>

<p class="vl">We do make mistakes.&nbsp; There are also several journalistically-correct ways to report most events, which is why no one should ever
get all their news from a single source.</p>

<p class="vl">I apologize for putting your most reasonable letters in the same pile as those who see conspiracy in every nook and cranny.</p>
