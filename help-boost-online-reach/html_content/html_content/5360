			<div class="entry">
				<p>As I discussed this in my (upcoming) manifesto: &#8220;geek living&#8221;, here are direct steps you can take to get leaner quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Drop sodas forever</b><br />
Sodas are the enemy number one of this society. Drop it and your GI will get lower instantly. This will change the direction your body is taking and will reduce the amount of food converted to fat. If you are addicted to soda or have cravings, make sure you have only one in the morning, and once every two days. Gradually drop to once a week until you are happy without them. They are the pest of our century and are the main reason of people looking unhealthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Drop fast-food forever</b><br />
Fast food are bloody expensive! They are the typical solution to an unorganized geek. Get organized at your next shopping day and make sure you don&#8217;t need it anymore. If you really like the taste and are addicted. Make sure you get what you like once a week only, and at lunch! That way, your addiction will fade away softly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Drop sugary food to only once a week</b><br />
Cakes, chocolate bars and such are also raising your GI and making your flubber shine. Don&#8217;t cut them off entirely of your life. For starters, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to do, second you will find that once a week is just enough!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Drop carbs at dinner</b><br />
Carbs are easily put to use by the body during the day. At night, they sit in your stomach and as you go asleep they will be more likely to be converted to fat. Carbs are converted to energy, which is used in your daily life. Unlike models, don&#8217;t drop carbs entirely or you will have serious issues at 50. Instead, reduce the carbs intake at dinner, as it won&#8217;t sit in your stomach all night. Carbs include pasta, potatoes, rice and bread. Also check the labels of whatever you&#8217;re eating at dinner to find out how much carbs it contains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eat dinner earlier</b><br />
This simple fact will allow you to digest better, and sleep better. If your body is able to process dinner before bed time, much less will sit there all night and turn into fat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Get physically active twice a week</b><br />
Sport is good. Any sport. From boxing to table-tennis. It makes you move, and that&#8217;s good for you. We live in a society that doesn&#8217;t make good use of our bodies. We&#8217;ve never moved so little. We travel by sitting, we work by sitting, we relax by sitting. This is just bad and it&#8217;s only getting worse. Find what you like and get involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sleep more</b><br />
In our fast paced life, sleep is a very underestimated asset. Good sleep makes you more focussed. It also helps the body recover and then get to work on itself. It takes about 7-8 hours for the body to recover, then after that it only starts to build and focus on what needs improvement. You can&#8217;t really get any better if you don&#8217;t sleep properly. Why do you think that babies sleep so much?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Increase protein intake</b><br />
Imagine a balance. To lose weight or get leaner, you will need to raise the amount of protein intake. It&#8217;s a very simple ratio: more protein than carbs in a day, and you get leaner. As bloody simple as it sounds. However, this is a hard task as carbs are everywhere, but decent intakes of protein are rare.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finally: WHY should you bother?</h3>
<p>Well it&#8217;s really simple. By looking better, you also get more lovable. People like someone who looks good. You can fight society or choose to be come a part of it. Your body is this interface that you carry around and it represents YOU. Whatever you do, it&#8217;s you. It&#8217;s time to take a hard look in the mirror and face the fact that you need to be living in society as a part of it. A leaner body will also increase your confidence and therefor your chances of success in whatever you&#8217;re trying to achieve. And finally, you will feel better.</p>

			<p>This works!  Except I have gone all the way!</p>
<p>4 months ago I stopped drinking sodas, stopped eating fast food.  It is never negotiable - it&#8217;s what I do and who I am now.  </p>
<p>I work out for 1.5 hours a day 6 days a week.</p>
<p>I eat low carb, low fat, high protein, high fiber meals - healthy meals.  I can have a huge Thai vegetarian meal!</p>
<p>I sleep 6 hours most nights.</p>
<p>I have lost 50 pounds in 12 weeks.</p>

			<p>It works. I dropped carbs almost completely for a couple of months. My belt-size dropped and I got thinner, and had more energy. But I LIKE my carbs and sugar, enough to be a little fatter, have a little less energy, be less attractive, and have a shorter life span. So I&#8217;m back on sugar. The energy part is the only thing that causes me to excercise at all. I&#8217;m a geek. Society doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>By dropping fast food, SODA, and eating dinner earlier I&#8217;ve already list 7 kg. <img src='http://g333k.glimpsr.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> I think soda is probably the worst!!!!</p>

			<p>I do agree with your point on being well rested as being a cornerstone of health; however your assumption that we need a minimum of 7-8 hours is false. Our sleep needs vary by individual and by age. For instance, newborns sleep much more than a teen or adult. Typically most literature suggests that the variance in sleep requirements is between 5-8 hours, depending on the individual.</p>

			<p>4,5, and 8 aren&#8217;t really true.  the whole low-carb craze has used bad science and the desire to sell books to spawn a bunch of carb-fearing maniacs.  carbs don&#8217;t make you fat, refined sugar and refined flour make you fat.  eating oats, or quinoa, or barley is great for you, it&#8217;s the enriched white flour that turns straight into sugar when digested and ends up stored as fat (aside from having no nutritional value).  high fructose corn syrup and enriched white flour are responsible for about 80% of the american obesity epidemic and removing foods containing them from your diet will cause a sizable weight loss.  not eating at night is also bunk - your body doesn&#8217;t stop digesting and using food just because you aren&#8217;t awake.  do you stop breathing, stop pumping blood, or stop growing hair when you sleep?  your body does most of its recovery and rebuilding when you sleep.  more protein than carbs isn&#8217;t a good idea either, even bodybuilders who eat huge amounts of protein get at least 10%-15% more of their calories from carbs than protein (even on cutting phases). also, make sure to eat lots of good fats if you want to loose weight (nuts, avocados, flax, coconut milk, fish, seaweed, etc.).  too much protein and too little fat will make you sick.</p>

			<p>@All: Thanks for the comments</p>
<p>@Rico: As you fall asleep, it&#8217;s a totally different world in your body. Subconscious takes over and the recovery process starts. Yes, your hair keeps growing indeed, but the fact that you sit absolutely still for hours changes the way the body is going to deal with what&#8217;s in your stomach.</p>
<p>The only consumption made by the body at the time is the required energy to maintain idle state of your muscles; and I will have to assume, most people don&#8217;t have much.</p>
<p>I think you misunderstood the post into one of those supermodel &#8216;cut carbs&#8217; diet. It&#8217;s not the case. It only explains that if you have an endomorph physiology, aka. you put on weight easy, dropping most carbs at dinner is going to reduce fat production during the night and remove the bloating. </p>
<p>Carbs are excellent! They&#8217;re the energy for christ sakes. Don&#8217;t cut them entirely! And exactly, bodybuilders do cut the carbs low during a cutting/chisel phase, but still keep some.<br />
Thanks for your input.</p>

			<p>I completely agree with removing carbs from your dinner.  First, it&#8217;s quite difficult to get a very large intake of calories from protein-only compared to carbs-only without eating a large amount of fat.  There are fewy protein heavy foods without fat that don&#8217;t also have a much higher amount of carbs (e.g. meat is often high in protein and fat but low in carbs, beans are low in fat, but high in carbs and protein).  The key for the dinner meal is to not make it a high fat or carb only meal such as pasta with sauce, this meal is much more appropriate for lunch.  Protein is more filling so your last meal of the day should ideally be heavy on protein so you don&#8217;t get the munchies late at night.  </p>
<p>Cutting out soda, fast food and sugar are key and the easiest way to achieve this, and this can require quite a bit of discipline, is to only eat whole and unprocessed foods or try to limit them.  This means no pre-made meals, very few packaged meals unless they are raw (such as frozen vegetables), limit canned soups and foods (including canned veggies as they are often preserved to a degree), and other processed foods.  Lots of salad, home made pasta, fresh cooked meat and raw vegetables are important.</p>
<p>Finally, munch on a carrot or two late at night just to quell any pending desires to snack and a few sticks of celery right before you go to bed won&#8217;t hurt and will keep you from thinking about how empty your stomach is as you drift off.</p>

			<p>actually during sleep (whether that be at night or extended periods during the day) your body lessens the release of a few enzymes you need to properly digest food (including carbs).  </p>
<p>like the very healthy peoples of the mediterrean you can eat very very late at night and not worry about piling on the pounds just because you are eating before you sleep.</p>
<p>BUT don&#8217;t think the reduced release of digestion enzymes late at night means you can overindulge then - you DO digest, just at a lower rate (which kinda makes up for the fact that you aren&#8217;t running around burning it off a few hours after you eat it).</p>
<p>just eat in moderation and have a balanced diet (seasonal, local and fresh is best).  it really doesn&#8217;t matter when you eat - just what and how much of it (how often vs three main meals is still being debated over, though it seems the grazing model is supported by more nutritionists - mostly because our ancestors did it that way and passed on those digestion tracts to us - but graze wisely - the food should be the healthy low glycemic index/high antioxidants foods you actually find when you graze - nuts and berries etc!)</p>

			<p>@Isabella: Thanks for your input, you have a nicer way of putting it into words than me. </p>
<p>Remember that I said &#8216;drop carbs at dinner&#8217; in the context of getting leaner quickly. It is not an optimal lifestyle.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s some good, easy-to-follow advice here. After losing 60lb last year (and keeping it off this year), I found a few trial-and-error tips that may help people trying to lose weight:</p>
<p>Protein powder is a low-calorie and reasonably low-cost way of increasing protein intake.</p>
<p>I work out with weights twice a week, as the more muscle mass I have, the more calories my body burns while at rest.</p>
<p>Multivitamins are an easy win. For example, if you lack Vitamin C, you burn 40% less fat during exercise (source: Men&#8217;s Health magazine). Vitamins and minerals empower your system to work effectively.</p>
<p>I drink soda occasionally, but it&#8217;s always sugar-free. I use dextrose, an ultra-high-GI sugar, to fuel my workouts. I&#8217;m happy with the balance I&#8217;ve struck with diet/exercise/relaxing, and it&#8217;s this tailored result which allows me to maintain it &#8212; which is really the most important thing.</p>

			<p>My advice would be to drop that laptop,  blueberry, Ipod, and Iphone, and live more like people did 100 years ago. Rely less on technology. Instead of using all the tech gadgets  to make life easier, learn to do things the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Walking a few blocks to a talk to a friend is healthier than slipping a phone out of a pocket.</p>
<p>Playing a sport instead of watching ESPN burns more calories and builds muscle tone.</p>
<p>Wash those dirty dishes by hand instead of putting them in the dishwater.</p>
<p>Write a letter instead of an email. Walk to the post office to mail it.</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;you get the idea.</p>

			<p>Eat ALL 100% Organic Fruits, vegetables and meat. Stay way from pork! It&#8217;s not a healthy meat like what most &#8220;people&#8221; say it is. If you want more info, Google: Pork Dangers. I have been overweight my entire life. I&#8217;ve tried everything with minimal effect. One month I lost alot of weight then gained it all back with +5 more pounds. I was almost in the range of obesity. Then a friend of mine, that I haven&#8217;t seen in years, bumped into me and he looked like he was working out! We used to have the same weight problem, then he moved to Oregon for work. I asked him how he did it. And he simply said eat Organic. He also mentioned to eat local if you can, the price of Organic food could be pretty high than you are used to. I figured, well so is a gym membership that would never be used and diet pills! what the hell, right?</p>
<p>It has been about a year now and I&#8217;ve maintained a 30 inch waist, healthy, and feeling pretty good! Another friend is slowly getting in to the process, and lots of pounds are shedding right off! My appitite is pretty good, with minimal cravings, however, if I feel the erge for something, I&#8217;ll make sure what ever I&#8217;m gonna scarf down, it&#8217;ll be 100% Organic. I can&#8217;t believe that even if you Pile on the Pasta, and it&#8217;s organic pasta, tomato sauce, etc. you&#8217;ll have a better chance in losing the weight, than to gain it.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t take my word for it. Do you&#8217;re own research on the benifits of Organic food.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget water (especially a really large glass the moment you wake up) and always have a really big breakfast (you need the fuel, to burn for the start of your day!)</p>
<p>Also, also&#8230;it will help if you knew how to cook, or start to get used to the idea. Save money! No junk food! Be realistic and start little by little. I would start with the condiments, toss all that (or give it away) and find organic replacements, but be careful for the &#8220;All Natural&#8221; labels. There are great stuff out there now that&#8217;s not too weird, just buy the real food. If it looks too complicated, don&#8217;t even try it. Read the labels and if you know what it is with out googling it, than it&#8217;s all good for the most part. Take the chemicals out and put some real stuff for a change! Go for it!</p>

			<p>You don&#8217;t have to go organic to be healthy. It&#8217;s usually over-priced beyond belief, for only a few more health befits like no pesticides. If you look closely, you&#8217;ll see a lot of companies jump at the chance to put organic on anything because they know they can up the price and people will still buy it.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that you can get fat on just liquids. That Starbucks frappicino you may adore is just terrible for you, and worst of all, you don&#8217;t even feel full from it, so you&#8217;ll be hungry soon after. So don&#8217;t just stay away from sodas. Stay away from those damned coffee shops if you don&#8217;t get just coffee. Those fru-fru drinks will make you gain weight like crazy.</p>

			<p>these are some great points.  when i stopped drinking soda at the beginning of the year, i lost 5lbs in just 4 days.</p>
<p>yes cutting out fast food does help, but if thats your option or you go hungry for lunch, then at least know whats healthy on the menu for you to have.  like at mcd&#8217;s, fruit &amp; walnut salads are to die for.  or get a grilled chicken sandwich and just cut out the mayo.</p>
<p>everyone that has ever wanted help losing weight NEEDS to go to:<br />
sparkpeople.com</p>
<p>it will totally help you!</p>

			<p>Eating before bed is actually a pretty important practice for a number of people.  The reason breakfast is called as it is, is for the fact that it&#8217;s the first meal in 8-10 hours.  Going periods like this without eating is considered a fast.  Hence, you&#8217;re breaking the fast.</p>
<p>What happens during a fast is the body switches from anabolic metabolism to catabolic metabolism due to a lack of nutrients in the digestive system.  When catabolic metabolism takes over, it starts to break down the most bio-available proteins around, which happen to be muslce tissue.  This is why, when attempting to lose weight, it&#8217;s imperative to have a slow-digesting protein like casein in the stomach at bedtime.  This provides the body with the nutrients necessary to maintain blood glucose levels and anabolic metabolism.</p>

			<p>Hey, I was doing this already!<br />
It really does work, cutting soda and fast food, and just riding my freaking bike to school (2 miles away, and a college campus too) and cooking  meals, and i&#8217;ve lost 25 pounds in just a few months! My clothes fit better and I feel great.</p>

			<p>Rico:<br />
You are completely wrong. Carbohydrates do in fact create the insulin response that instructs the body to store fat. You&#8217;re clearly caught up in the &#8220;being critical of diet plan authors&#8221; craze, and it&#8217;s sad.</p>
<p>If you want to see how your body works, google &#8220;CKD&#8221;.</p>

Peter Kelders book &#8220;Ancient Secrets of The Fountain of Youth.&#8221; I have been doing it for years. Takes about 15 minutes a day. Strange but true.</p>

			<p>I started a new job and was going to Blimpie&#8217;s nearly every day.  I knew where this was headed!</p>
<p>Now I take a banana, an apple and a orange to work.  I don&#8217;t eat any processed food to speak of. However, I do love my coffee with 1/2 and 1/2 (non-dairy creamer is bad for you) and sugar.  I probably take in 300 calories a day just in sugar which is bad but I more than make up for that at lunch plus my coffee has only 1/5 the sugar of cola, probably less caffeine (arabica) and is loaded with antioxidants since I drink it fresh.</p>
<p>My motivation is to lean down a bit so I can bike to work more easily come spring.  To all you Floridians and Californians that think I should be biking to work already: it was 5 degrees yesterday morning and this morning we had 1/4 of ice coating everything. </p>
