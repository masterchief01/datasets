      <h4>Vitamin C</h4>
      <p>Ascorbic acid. A water soluble vitamin which is easily destroyed by cooking 
        and by contact with alkaline substances. Some vitamin C is lost in freezing 
        and preserving, and it is also easily oxidised.</p>
      <h3>Deficiency</h3>
      <p>At its extreme, vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy, a disease characterised 
        in its early stages by swelling and bleeding gums, loosened teeth, followed 
        by muscular weakness, joint damage and subcutaneous haemorrhages. Less 
        extreme shortage of this vitamin leads to tender joints, bleeding gums, 
        fatigue, general weakness, lowered resistance to disease and muscle degeneration. 
        The body needs to build up a reserve of ascorbic acid, by receiving regular 
        daily supplies: scurvy is still a problem today during the long winter 
        months in Scandinavian countries where fresh fruit and vegetables are 
        in short supply, and the body's reserves are depleted.</p>
      <h3>Overdose</h3>
      <p>Large doses of vitamin C can generally be taken without any problems, 
        though some people may find that they have stomach problems with an intake 
        of several grams a day. It is best to increase and decrease the amount 
        taken gradually, as a sharp increase in vitamin C can cause diarrhoea, 
        while suddenly cutting off a high daily dose can cause fatigue.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>Vitamin C is vital for the formation of collagen and connective tissue 
        - tendons, ligaments and cartilage. It maintains the strength of the walls 
        of blood vessels and helps the body to absorb iron. It helps fight infection 
        and diseases such as high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis and cancer.</p>
      <p>In larger doses, it is an antioxidant, mopping up the oxygen free radicals 
        that destroy cells and cause ageing. It also makes an important contribution 
        to the antioxidant action of other vitamins, particularly <a href="/vitamin2.html#vita">vitamin 
        A</a> and <a href="#vite">vitamin E</a>. Caution is required in preparing 
        foods to gain maximum benefit from the vitamin C. If the vitamin itself 
        becomes oxidised, it will encourage the production of free radicals, rather 
        than fighting them. Oxidation can be caused by the metals iron and copper 
        in food when the vitamin C's cell membranes have been weakened by cooking.</p>
      <p>It is believed that ascorbic acid in larger doses may help prevent cancer 
        by&nbsp; stopping the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines from nitrates 
        and nitrites present in food. It also improves the function of while blood 
        cells, which fight viruses, bacteria and cancer cells.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with <a href="/vitamin2.html#vitb1">vitamin B1</a> and 
        the amino acid cysteine, vitamin C helps to counteract the damaging chemicals 
        produced in the body by alcohol, nicotine, exhaust fumes and the toxic 
        heavy metal, cadmium.</p>
      <p>Recent studies show that vitamin C also helps to prevent the formation 
        of bad cholesterol and reduces levels of LDL cholesterol in the body. 
        It may thus be involved in protecting us from high blood pressure and 
        arteriosclerosis.</p>
      <h3>Sources</h3>
      <p>Vitamin C is found in citrus fruit, berries, tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, 
        cauliflower, potatoes, fresh green vegetables and chillies. Remember how 
        easily it is destroyed by heat, light and freezing - try to eat fresh, 
        uncooked fruit and vegetables for maximum vitamin C.</p>
      <h3>RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)</h3>
      <p>The RDA for vitamin C is 60 mg for a healthy adult. Pregnant women, smokers 
        and heavy drinkers need more. All RDAs are calculated as the minimum levels 
        required in order to prevent the occurrence of well-known vitamin deficiency 
        symptoms. </p>
      <p>Since the idea of RDAs was generally accepted, much more has been learnt 
        about the benefits of various vitamins, and doses well above RDA levels 
        are commonly used to help prevent disease and boost the immune system, 
        as shown above.</p>

      <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <h4><a name="vitd" id="vitd"></a></h4>
      <h4>Vitamin D</h4>
      <p>Vitamin D is actually a group of hormone-like chemicals called steroid 
        alcohols. The vitamin group is fat-soluble and quite stable: it won't 
        be lost in storage, cooking or processing. The skin is able to manufacture 
        vitamin D - up to 10 IU per square centimetre, depending on the level 
        of pigmentation (darker skins produce less) and the amount of air pollution 
        (pollution absorbs ultraviolet light, preventing so much of it penetrating 
        the skin and thus enabling the production of the vitamin).</p>
      <h3>Deficiency</h3>
      <p>The extreme deficiency condition is rickets, where childrens' bones grow 
        irregularly and become soft, leading to distorted limbs, swollen joints 
        and chest deformities. Although still seen in the third world, rickets 
        is rare in industrialised countries. In adults, the equivalent condition 
        is osteomalacia, where calcium is withdrawn from the bones, softening 
        them and causing pain, weakness and fractures. This condition is most 
        likely to occur during pregnancy. Less extreme shortage of vitamin D can 
        lead to dental caries in children, muscle weakness and cramp, and if it 
        is prolonged, osteoporosis. It is absorbed through the small intestine, 
        and requires bile for the process. So diseases of the pancreas, gall bladder, 
        liver or intestine, can reduce the absorption of vitamin D</p>
      <h3>Overdose</h3>
      <p>One of the main functions of vitamin D is to enable the body to absorb 
        <a href="mineral1.html#calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="mineral1.html#phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, 
        and because of this, excess amounts of the vitamin can be harmful, leading 
        to over-calcification of the bones and teeth, formation of calculus stones 
        in the kidneys and hardening of the arteries due to calcium deposits. 
        Early signs of overdose include itchy eyes and skin, unquenchable thirst, 
        diarrhoea and generalised physical discomfort.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>Vitamin D acts like a hormone, affecting processes in various parts of 
        the body. It is essential to the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, 
        so it is essential to the proper development and continued health of teeth 
        and bones. It also regulates the permeability of cell membranes.</p>
      <h3>Sources</h3>
      <p>Vitamin D is found in animal fats, such as butter, eggs, liver, oily 
        fish (kippers, mackerel, sardines and tuna), margarine, full-fat dairy 
        products and evaporated or malted milk. Milk is not in itself a good source 
        of vitamin D, unless it has been fortified (this is done routinely in 
        the United States, Canada and many other countries, although not in Britain.) 
        It is possible to buy dairy milk and soya milk fortified with vitamin 
        D in this country, from specialist suppliers.</p>
      <h3>RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)</h3>
      <p>The RDA for vitamin D is around 400 IU for adults, 1000 IU for babies 
        up to 2 years and between 500 - 1000 for older children. Pregnant women 
        should have between 400 - 800 IU per day. If a reasonable diet is eaten, 
        supplements are not likely to be needed except perhaps during the dark 
        winter months, for children and the elderly.</p>

      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h4><a name="vite" id="vite"></a></h4>
      <h4>Vitamin E</h4>
      <p>Once again, this vitamin is actually a group of chemical compounds which 
        all act in the same way. The most common is alpha-tocopherol (it also 
        exists in beta- gamma- and delta- forms). The body cannot produce vitamin 
        E, so we we have to get it from our diet. It is fat-soluble.</p>
      <h3>Deficiency</h3>
      <p>Lack of vitamin E causes reproductive problems - infertility, increased 
        risk of miscarriage, etc. It also causes degeneration of the kidneys and 
        general wasting symptoms.</p>
      <h3>Overdose</h3>
      <p>It is almost impossible to overdose on vitamin E. Large scale studies 
        have shown that people can take up to 10 grams a day for extended periods 
        without adverse effects, though some individuals find that doses in excess 
        of 1 gram a day can cause stomach problems.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>Vitamin E is known to be essential for muscle development and for preventing 
        the red blood cells from breaking down. It also believed to be important 
        in maintaining reproductive health, though it is not yet clear by what 
        mechanism. It protects against miscarriage by promoting the healthy development 
        of the foetus. It also has a vital role as an antioxidant, protecting 
        cells from attack by free radicals and peroxides. The more research is 
        carried out, the more beneficial results seem to be attributable to vitamin 
        E. It can help to prevent cancers developing, when taken in combination 
        with <a href="#">selenium</a>, and seems to reduce the unwanted side effects 
        of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. At high doses (800mg a day) it acts 
        as an anticoagulant, preventing the formation of clots and thromboses, 
        and has been found to be beneficial in correcting cardiovascular disorders 
        like intermittent claudication - though this latter typically takes several 
        months to show improvement. It is generally helpful in boosting the immune 
        system and increasing resistance to viral and bacterial infection, in 
        doses of between 5 - 20mg per kilo of body weight (350 - 1400mg for someone 
        weighing 70kg). For cataract prevention, daily doses between 300 - 400 
        mg are effective, particularly combined with <a href="#vitc">vitamin C</a> 
        and <a href="vitamin2.html#vit1">beta-carotene</a>. Recent studies suggest 
        that, in common with other anti-oxidants, it may have a contribution to 
        make in preventing the onset of Parkinson's disease, or slowing the deterioration 
        it causes: doses of 400 - 3200 mg combined with 300mg of vitamin C seem 
        beneficial.&nbsp;Scandinavian research indicates that a 400 mg supplement 
        of vitamin E with selenium can give a significant&nbsp; boost to the physical 
        and psychological health of elderly people.</p>
      <h3>Sources</h3>
      <p>Good sources of vitamin E include wheatgerm, soya, corn and peanut oils, 
        margarine, raw nuts and seeds, eggs, butter, yams, liver and some green 
        leafy vegetables. It is, however, quite easy to destroy vitamin E by freezing, 
        processing, preserving and simple contact with the air.</p>
      <h3>RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)</h3>
      <p> The RDA is about 12mg, but the notes above highlight the effects of 
        this vitamin in quantities well above the RDA.</p>
      <p><a href="#topofvit">Top of page</a></p>
      <h4><a name="vith" id="vith"></a></h4>
      <h4>Vitamin H</h4>
      <p>Also known as biotin - and still the subject of debate as to whether 
        it is a vitamin in its own right, or part of the B complex. It is water 
        soluble, and is manufactured in the body by intestinal bacteria in quantities 
        that are sufficient to meet most requirements.</p>
      <h3>Deficiency</h3>
      <p>Deficiency can occur, particularly in elderly people, athletes and epileptics 
        - all of whom tend to have relatively low levels of biotin in their blood. 
        Symptoms include loss of appetite, infections of the mucous membranes, 
        depression, insomnia, rashes, increased blood cholesterol levels. Rarely, 
        children may develop a form of eczema or a fungal skin disorder due to 
        biotin deficiency, but these and all other symptoms can be relieved very 
        quickly with a simple daily supplement.</p>
      <h3>Overdose</h3>
      <p>No cases of biotin overdose have ever been reported.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>Biotin is part of the process which produces energy from dietary glucose, 
        and also the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (amino 
        acids). It boosts the efficiency of the immune system and helps with the 
        manufacture of antibodies. Trials have been conducted in which it was 
        used to stop hair loss, in combination with various minerals and other 
        compounds, but the results were mixed.</p>
      <h3>Sources</h3>
      <p>It is found in liver, kidney, egg yolk, yeast, oats, nuts, milk chocolate 
        and most vegetables.</p>
      <h3>RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)</h3>
      <p> The RDA for men and women is 60 micrograms.</p>
      <p><a href="#topofvit">Top of page</a></p>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h4><a name="vitk" id="vitk"></a></h4>
      <h4>Vitamin K</h4>
      <p>This fat soluble vitamin exists in three forms: phytomenadione, menaquinane 
        and menadione. Essentially it is a group of similar compounds, called 
        quinones, which are required for a healthy body. Most of the vitamin K 
        we need is produced by bacteria in the intestine.</p>
      <h3>Deficiency</h3>
      <p>Deficiency may prevent the blood from clotting properly, and trigger 
        the development of osteoporosis, as vitamin K is required for calcium 
        to form new bone. People with conditions that prevent the proper absorption 
        of fat may have a deficiency, as may alcoholics and anyone who doesn't 
        eat sufficient green vegetables. Prolonged use of antibiotics also reduces 
        the body's ability to make vitamin K.</p>
      <h3>Overdose</h3>
      <p>Too much vitamin K could cause jaundice in babies.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>The vital functions of vitamin K are associated with formation of coagulation 
        factors, which clot the blood so that wounds can heal properly, and the 
        proper calcification of bones. It has been shown that vitamin K supplements 
        reduce the loss of calcium from the bones of osteoporosis sufferers, and 
        speeds the healing of healing of bone fractures. Supplements are sometimes 
        given to patients before major surgery.</p>
      <h3>Sources</h3>
      <p>It is found in green vegetables, seaweed, potaotes, liver, eggs, wheatgerm, 
        fish, nuts, alfalfa, molasses, yoghurt, dairy products, corn oil and soya 
        oil. </p>
      <h3>RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)</h3>
      <p> There is no official RDA, but an average adult requirement is 1 mg.</p>
      <p><a href="#topofvit">Top of page</a></p>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h4><a name="vitp" id="vitp"></a></h4>
      <h4>Vitamin P</h4>
      <p>Also known as bioflavinoids. This group of pigments occurs in fruits 
        and vegetables that are yellow or orange in colour.</p>
      <h3>Deficiency</h3>
      <p>Deficiency leads to bleeding from the tiny blood capillaries into the 
        surrounding tissue, and an inability for the body to absorb and metabolise 
        <a href="#vitc">vitamin C</a> properly.</p>
      <h3>Overdose</h3>
      <p>No cases are known.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>Vitamin P works to strengthen the walls of the blood vessels, and it 
        is essential for the body to use vitamin C properly. Some athletes take 
        a supplement as they believe bioflavinoids will help joint and muscle 
        injuries to heal more quickly. They can also help to reduce high blood 
        pressure (hypertension).</p>
      <h3>Sources</h3>
      <p>Found in citrus fruits, carrots, rosehips, plums. </p>
      <h3>RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance)</h3>
      <p> There isn't an official RDA, and it is thought that the human requirement 
        is very small.</p>
