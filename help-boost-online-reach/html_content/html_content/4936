<p>The editors at <a href="http://www.masters-in-health-administration.com">Master&apos;s in Health Administration Degrees</a> decided to research the topic of:</p>

<h2>10 Revolutionary Medical Advancements on the Horizon</h2>

<p>A 69-year-old today has the same likelihood of dying as a 15-year-old hunter-gatherer once had. We are living longer and longer lives, and in the next decade, several new technologies and procedures could extend our lives further. Learn about just a few of the innovations that could save your life someday.</p>


<h3>Remote Surgery</h3>

 <br />- Present Day: Surgeons already perform some surgeries by controlling robotic arms from a nearby console.
 <br />- The Idea: Why can't surgeons do the same thing from farther away?
 <br />- The Advantages: 
 <br />- Robotic surgery expected to cut deaths after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery from 10% to <3%.
 <br />- World-class surgeons more accessible, even in war zones, from anywhere in the world. 
 <br />- The Next Step: Improving connectivity and reducing transmission delays. 

<h3>Genome-Customized Medications</h3>
 <br />- Present Day: More efficient methods of sequencing the human genome are utilized every day. 
 <br />- The Idea: Medication can be diagnosed, or even custom-made, based on an individual's genome.
 <br />- The Advantages:
 <br />- Diseases can be predicted and prevented decades before they appear.
 <br />- Replacement of trial-and-error prescription with safer, more effective drugs and dosages.
 <br />- The Next Step: 
 <br />- Overcoming the challenges of finding specific genes affecting drug response.
 <br />- More widespread pharmacogenomics expected in the next 4 years. 



<h3>Catheter-Based Renal Denervation</h3> 
 <br />- Present Day: Named the #1 Medical Innovation for 2012 by the Cleveland Clinic. 
 <br />- The Idea: 40-minute procedure reduces blood pressure, controls resistant hypertension, and possibly helps treat insulin resistance, chronic kidney disease and heart failure.
 <br />- The Advantages:
 <br />- 1 in 3 U.S. adults has hypertension.
 <br />- #1 risk factor for death worldwide.
 <br />- 30% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.
 <br />- The Next Step: Trials with more patients and longer follow-up are required. 

<h3>Nanomedicine</h3> 
 <br />- Present Day: Some drug-delivery nanotechnologies are already in use. 
 <br />- The Idea: Fabricating nanotechnology or controlling matter at a molecular scale can provide diagnoses/target treatments for a broad range of diseases.
 <br />- The Advantages: 
 <br />- Target tumor cells without the side effects of chemotherapy.
 <br />- Remove barriers to the circulatory system and repair damaged tissues.
 <br />- The Next Step: Machines that can build nanoprobes are still 10-20 years away, but drug-delivery nanomedicine is further along. 



<h3>New Cancer-Detection Methods</h3> 
 <br />- Present Day: A sports bra in development can detect breast cancer up to 6 years before a tumor is visible. 
 <br />- The Idea: Cancer-detection systems that find cancer earlier and don't even require a doctor.
 <br />- The Advantages: 
 <br />- Reduce the need for painful diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.
 <br />- Handheld optical scan identifies 98% of melanomas. 
 <br />- The Next Step:
 <br />- A breath test for lung cancer is 9 years away.
 <br />- Urine tests for bladder cancer are 4 years away. 


<h3>Wireless Body Monitoring</h3> 
 <br />- Present Day: FCC announced new measures to promote wireless health technology in September. 
 <br />- The Idea: Monitoring the body wirelessly helps doctors/patients intervene more quickly.
 <br />- The Advantages: 
 <br />- Wireless radio pills log when patients take their medicine. 
 <br />- Blood pressure, blood sugar, calorie and weight data used as a tool for healthier living.
 <br />- Wireless patches alert women when they're fertile. 
 <br />- The Next Step: Cost is the biggest factor holding this research back.


<h3>Bone Regeneration</h3>
 <br />- Present Day: Instead of grafting bone from the pelvis, spine surgeons are applying bone growth factor to accelerate healing. 
 <br />- The Idea: Stem cells and bone growth factor as new means of bone replacement. 
 <br />- The Advantages: 
 <br />- Alternative to bone fusions, 30%-40% of which don't heal.  
 <br />- Reduces risk of virus transmission and rejection from cadaver-harvested bone grafts. 
 <br />- The Next Step: Biological joint replacement still in testing stages. New synthetic bone-graft materials are appearing on the market.


<h3>Bariatric Surgery for Type 2 diabetes</h3> 
 <br />- Present Day: Bariatric surgery helps patients lose weight. 
 <br />- The Idea: Patients have been rid of Type 2 diabetes even before they left the hospital post-surgery. 
 <br />- The Advantages: Reduces risk of diabetes-induced heart attack, stroke, blindness and other illnesses.
 <br />- The Next Step: Experts recommend earlier surgery for patients with poorly managed Type 2 diabetes.


<h3>Neuromodulation Device for Headaches</h3> 
 <br />- Present Day: Available in Europe. 
 <br />- The Idea: Surgically implanted device stimulates a nerve bundle behind the nose to fight headaches.
 <br />- The Advantages: 
 <br />- Can reduce cluster and migraine headache pain in 5-10 minutes.
 <br />- 68% of patients responded to neuromodulation therapy in European testing.
 <br />- The Next Step: FDA has approved investigational use in the U.S. 


<h3>Donor Lung Washing Procedure</h3> 
 <br />- Present Day: Approved in Europe and Canada. 
 <br />- The Idea: "Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion" repairs and assesses damaged donor lungs in 4-6 hours. 
 <br />- The Advantage:
 <br />- 100,000 Americans are on the lung transplant list. 
 <br />- Could make 40% of previously rejected donor lungs suitable for transplant. 
 <br />- The Next Step: Undergoing a major clinical trial in the U.S.

<p>New medical advances are appearing every day. Staying aware of these innovations could add years to your life.</p>
