		<h2><a href="http://17andbaking.com/2011/03/25/peanut-butter-pretzel-bites-dipped-in-chocolate/">Peanut Butter Pretzel Bites (dipped in&nbsp;chocolate!)</a></h2>

		<p><a title="Peanut Butter Pretzel Bites (dipped in chocolate) by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5557831338/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5225/5557831338_32ccf0c532_o.jpg" alt="Peanut Butter Pretzel Bites (dipped in chocolate)" width="475" height="598" /></a></p>
<p>Inspiration has hit me again. Pretty hard. And this time I think it’ll be harder to shake.</p>
<p>I had some free time between classes, so I went to the store. For the first time in my life, I bought myself basic ingredients, starting with absolutely nothing. I tried to balance quality and price as I grabbed flour, sugar (white, brown, and powdered), vanilla, salt, butter, cream, and eggs… At the very last minute, standing in the check out line, I ran back to get baking powder and soda. Almost forgot.</p>
<p>When the total came up and I took out my wallet, I mentally calculated how many tables I’d have to wait to gain it back. Since when was baking such an expensive hobby?</p>
<p>This being-an-adult, shopping-for-your-own-groceries thing is tough. But I smiled the whole ride home.</p>
<p><a title="Peanut Butter Pretzel Bites by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5557831386/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5063/5557831386_d6328cbf1c.jpg" alt="Peanut Butter Pretzel Bites" width="475" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>As the week went on, the anticipation grew. I think this is what I discovered. When the only times you bake are for dinner with the neighbors, birthdays, holidays and paid orders, something is wrong. When you’re baking just because? Because you want to, because it’s Thursday, because there are four pounds of sugar under your bed? These reasons are happiness-generators, like fresh batches of Play Doh and abandoned fields of dandelions.</p>
<p>Faced with the freedom of no guidelines, I couldn’t decide whether to go crunchy or chewy, warm or chilled, chocolate-glazed or baked with fruit. On Saturday I was sure I would make a citrusy pound cake. Sunday I’d switched to some kind of breakfast scone, easy to share with the common room… By Tuesday I found myself wanting a few secret pots de creme in my mini-fridge, a midnight snack just for me.</p>
<p>Then, considering the mediocre fruit selection in the dining hall at lunchtime, it hit me. I took three ripe pears and looked up a recipe for clafouti. I packed all the ingredients and tools, plus a book and my camera. I lugged the ridiculously heavy bag down the street to the dorm building that has kitchens.</p>
<p><a title="Peanut Butter by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5557831152/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5171/5557831152_da46a4c90b.jpg" alt="Peanut Butter" width="475" height="381" /></a></p>
<p>The kitchen was a bit of a letdown. There was no soap by the sink for dishes. The windows were blocked by buildings and didn’t let in any natural light, so no photographs. But I figured out how to work the oven, mixed the clafouti batter as best I could, and hoped for success. I sat down to read and discovered that, somewhere in Chapter 2, I could smell sugar.</p>
<p>I pulled the puffed, golden-brown custard out of the oven and experienced a more real satisfaction than I could have possibly imagined. My bones felt solid, my lungs felt full, and would you believe it, I felt starved. I washed the dishes and repacked the bag in a dream, and as I turned to leave, I grabbed the still-hot pan without thinking. My hand automatically opened and the clafouti splattered like vanilla-infused ink. The metal pan clattered against the linoleum and I thought it would never stop ringing in my ears and in the corners of the empty kitchen.</p>
<p>Empty-handed, without photos or a taste. Bitterness started to settle like steeping tea.</p>
<p><a title="Peanut Butter Pretzel Bites by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5557246011/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5258/5557246011_ef48c8f7e3.jpg" alt="Peanut Butter Pretzel Bites" width="475" height="384" /></a></p>
<p>But then, in spite of myself, I laughed. No regrets, no tears. Because, let’s be real, it was a pretty stupid move on my part, but it didn’t take away any of the pleasure I got from the baking process. Blog post or not, for one afternoon, I felt unfiltered elation. Maybe there was a lesson in the unsalvageable clafouti – the joy comes from the process, not from being recognized as the “baking blogger” or from eating a lot of cream.</p>
<p>Instead, I’m sharing these Peanut Butter Pretzel bites with you. They’re easy enough to make from a dorm. Creamy peanut butter, sugar, and vanilla combine in a rich and addictive filling. Sandwiched between two crisp, salty pretzels and dunked in bittersweet chocolate, you end up with an incredible party snack that vanishes fast.</p>
<p>No mixer required. No fiddling with foreign ovens. You can even melt the chocolate in the microwave (which I did.) The result is a delicious, one bite contradiction of creamy and crunchy, sweet and salty, peanutty and chocolatey.</p>

<p>I knew right away they wouldn’t survive the weekend, but that’s okay. I’ve still got 3 ½ pounds of sugar under my bed. That’s reason enough for me.</p>

		<p><a title="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5528608484/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5211/5528608484_d739bc96bb.jpg" alt="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee" width="475" height="378" /></a></p>
<p>17 and Baking turns two years old this week. I almost missed it.</p>
<p>In the past, I spent afternoons alone in the kitchen, flour dusting my palms and lots of quiet thoughts in my head. Afterwards I wrote about the baking process, my love for fresh ingredients, the joy of brainstorming desserts and sharing them with my family. I had more ideas than photographs.</p>
<p>I went a record-breakingly long time without posting as of today. Looking at my life it’s clear why I’m struggling to blog. Though I’m happier than ever, I&#8217;m living between sips of coffee and half hour power-naps. The biggest issue is that I haven’t been baking. At all. I use photographs of desserts I baked last summer to keep this blog running. While there’s a trunk of baking supplies beneath my bed and a working oven in the dorm building down the street, I haven’t used it once this year.</p>
<p><a title="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5528019797/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5013/5528019797_097aef6621.jpg" alt="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee" width="475" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Over Thanksgiving and winter break, reunited with family, I obligingly creamed butter and whipped cream, but frankly, much of the magic was gone. I’ve never lost my passions for writing, photography and baking, but my weariness shows. I’m scared that 17 and Baking is in decline, that I’m losing something I consider such an important part of myself.</p>
<p>My boyfriend I-’s birthday was a few Fridays ago. He wanted to go up to Maine and spend several days with his family, and at the last minute I went along too.</p>
<p>“You’ll be able to bake,” he said, convincing me to come.</p>
<p>I was nervous to meet his parents and sister and his friends, more nervous than I wanted to let on. But for the first time in a long time, I was excited to make something for his birthday. That outburst of butterflies in my chest was so comfortingly familiar, so nearly forgotten, it was almost painful.</p>
<p><a title="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5528016321/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5175/5528016321_23b6e8007a.jpg" alt="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee" width="475" height="364" /></a></p>
<p>The next afternoon we drove to the local grocery store. I’m not used to buying staples at once – usually I have all the basic ingredients on hand, though I might need more chocolate slabs or an unusual spice. We picked up flour, sugar, heavy cream, local homemade butter. But I couldn’t decide what to make. I hadn’t flipped through a cookbook or wanted to make something in so long, and I actually felt out of my element in the baking aisle.</p>
<p>I- kept making suggestions, and I kept shooting them down. The possibilities were overwhelming. “You have to pick something,” he said finally as we wheeled the cart around the entire store for the third or fourth time. “Make a pecan pie.”</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>We threw pecans into the cart. “Maybe some walnuts?” I- was holding another bag. “Those might be good with the pecans.” Into the cart. “Milk chocolate toffee bits? In the pie? Yes?” Yes. He kept smiling whenever he saw me start to smile back.</p>
<p>I don’t always like getting a million suggestions from someone else when it comes to baking, but I didn’t mind. Even when he paused at the end of the aisle and added, “You should put in some coconut.” I know my dad will picture my usual eye-roll and heavy sigh but instead I said, “Why not?”</p>
<p><a title="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5528609904/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5013/5528609904_eb2ea2faa3.jpg" alt="Coconut Pecan &quot;Why Not&quot; Pie with Walnuts and Toffee" width="475" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>I watched every bag, carton, box pass across the scanner and pack into shopping bags. I helped carry them to the car trunk. At the house, I arranged them on the counter and stared for a good minute. It felt unreal.</p>
<p>I winged a good deal of the recipe, just throwing things in. I-’s mom and sister popped in a few times to see how I was making the pie totally from scratch. There was a moment when the crust was in the freezer and the nuts were all chopped in a bowl and suddenly I felt like I was breathing for the first time in months.</p>
<p>I-’s family and I ate dinner together as the pie cooled in the kitchen. When the plates were cleared, I’-s dad went next door to borrow a bit of bourbon so I could make bourbon whipped cream. I beat the cream to stiff peaks, folded in the bourbon, and cut the pie. I could feel my heart thumping and the heat rising to my cheeks as the first slices made it to the table, so nervous. What if it wasn’t good? What if I was really, really out of practice?</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh,” somebody said, and round 2 of pie became a reality.</p>

<p>Later I- and I brought a wedge of pie over to the neighbors, along with some whipped cream. It turned out the bourbon was decades old, saved from a wedding. I couldn’t believe something so special had been opened and shared. When I- and I headed back to his house, I kept hoping the pie would be delicious, wanting them to get as much happiness from it as possible.</p>
<p>None of the whipped cream survived the night, but in the morning, I pulled out the Canon and shot some food photography for the first time in too long.</p>
<p>An out-of-the-blue pecan pie, dropped into my life weeks before 17 and Baking turns two. There are a lot of things I love about this pie &#8211; it&#8217;s sophisticated and rustic, unfussy with complex flavors. It isn&#8217;t overly sweet or sticky and there&#8217;s no light corn syrup involved. I love that my boyfriend came up with most of it. I love that it was shared and gobbled up embarrassingly fast. In so many ways, this pie reminded me of why I love to bake and why I’ll continue to blog.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, 17 and Baking. Eat some pie.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://17andbaking.com/2011/02/18/chocolate-dipped-coconut-macaroons/">Chocolate-Dipped Coconut&nbsp;Macaroons</a></h2>

		<p><a title="Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5455740818/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5091/5455740818_e1ba601106.jpg" alt="Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons" width="475" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>This morning I woke up with an inexplicable craving for bubble tea.</p>
<p>Instead I ate a bowl of cereal and made it to class barely on time. I took notes, asked questions, and when I walked out the door, it felt like October instead of mid February. The temperature flirted with the low 40s. Cause for celebration! I wore a flowery skirt, smiled at strangers, and I still wanted bubble tea.</p>
<p>I didn’t even drop off my bags. I walked straight from the classroom, down the street into Boston’s Chinatown, knowing exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p><a title="Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5455128283/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5137/5455128283_1d1bce9c8c.jpg" alt="Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons" width="475" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>A few weeks before Halloween, when I was still in the process of making friends in a big new world, my floormate M- and I decided to get lunch. We’re both half Asian, and we both missed Chinese food, so we headed into Chinatown together.</p>
<p>Chinatown is squeezed between Downtown Crossing and the South End. It’s small, but dense, stuffed with grocery stores, jewelry shops, and narrow brick alleyways. Heaps of snow stay frozen solid in the shadows of tall buildings pressed close together. Cars honk. The edges of sidewalks are congested with scraps of packaging and cigarette butts, and you can’t see what’s around the corner until you actually turn, but what can I say? I love Chinatowns. They’ve got a character you can’t quite capture anywhere else.</p>
<p>M- and I didn’t know where to get good food, so we explored until we found a tiny but promising café. There were no tables, just a laminated menu taped to a counter and a long line. We ordered rice, barbeque chicken, pork buns, and why not – two coconut bubble teas.</p>
<p><a title="Flaked Coconut by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5455740798/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5051/5455740798_518b82b6d9.jpg" alt="Flaked Coconut" width="475" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>The food was good, but the bubble tea was the star of the meal. Thick and fragrant, it used coconut cream, not powder. Every sip tasted tropical and real – like a spoon scraped against the white walls of a split coconut – as opposed to the suntan lotion taste of most imitations. It was good enough to remember months later.</p>
<p>I could recall the bubble tea fairly well, but I had no idea how to get there. I wandered into Chinatown and made lefts and rights at random, ending up on crooked side streets lined with shops like uneven teeth. Just when I was about to give up, I recognized the sign, innocently tucked between a row of restaurant windows. I ran through a puddle of melted snow and across the empty street, yanked open the door and bought myself a bubble tea.</p>
<p>It didn’t even survive the trip home. Not a big surprise, considering I got lost on the way back. I&#8217;ll have to adventure into Chinatown walkabout-style every time I want to rediscover this bubble tea, but I think it&#8217;s a worthwhile experience.</p>
<p><a title="Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5455740832/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5138/5455740832_63bc5d7a28.jpg" alt="Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons" width="475" height="391" /></a></p>
<p>Back when I worked at <a href="http://www.seastarrestaurant.com/bellevue.php?page=Home">Seastar Restaurant</a>, with chefs all around me baking chocolate molten cakes and slow-cooking cedar plank salmon, coconut was my favorite smell in the entire restaurant. We&#8217;d spread flakes of coconut on a baking sheet and toast them, later to be sprinkled over the white chocolate coconut cream pie. After mere minutes in the oven, the most seductive smell wafted down the line. No matter what I was doing, I&#8217;d start to work in a daze, dreaming of paradise.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t understand when people say they hate coconut. I can, however, see why some people don&#8217;t like coconut macaroons. Too often they&#8217;re over-the-top sweet and gluey.</p>
<p>But when you find a good macaroon you get something special. The cookie is light and chewy, with toasty crisp edges. The coconut flavor is pure, not masked by sugar. A dip in dark chocolate adds richness without cloying sweetness. It&#8217;s dynamite. How could you not want more?</p>
<p><em>[Writing, baking, photographing. Blogging. Waitressing. Radio-ing. A second job with the admissions office at my school. Homework. ...Sleep? I don't know how I managed to make second semester even busier than my first, but I'm really trying. Thanks for sticking through with me!]</em></p>

<p>It&#8217;s the middle of the week and I&#8217;m ridiculously happy. I feel like saltwater taffy, like glass beads sitting in sunlight, like rainbows from the garden hose. I&#8217;m so excited to FINALLY share a top-secret project with you, after nearly a year of preparation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kitchengeneration.com">The Kitchen Generation</a>.</p>
<p>I guess I should back up and start with April 2010, when a mutual friend introduced me to Kamran of <a href="http://www.sophisticatedgourmet.com/">The Sophisticated Gourmet</a>. We were both 18, we both wore the many hats of a food blogger (photographer, cook, stylist, writer) and we both shared a disproportionate love for dark chocolate. He lived in New York and I lived in Seattle, but what did distance matter?</p>
<p>Less than an hour after Kam and I met, we had connected with three other young food bloggers. There was 17-year-old Lauren of <a href="http://www.celiacteen.com/">Celiac Teen</a>, 19-year-old Tessa of <a href="http://handletheheat.com/">Handle the Heat</a>, and 20-year-old Hannah of <a href="http://www.honeyandjam.com/">honey &amp; jam</a>. I sent out an email to all four with the subject &#8220;Teen baking group??&#8221; and the rest is history.</p>
<p><a title="friends by Elissa @ 17 and Baking, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17andbaking/5414100488/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5099/5414100488_544e75c227.jpg" alt="friends" width="429" height="121" /></a></p>
<p>We have our differences. We hail from different parts of North America &#8211; Kam in the northeast (New York), Hannah in the southeast (Georgia), Tessa in the southwest (Arizona), Lauren in Canada, and me in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle.)</p>
<p>We have unique perspectives. Kam&#8217;s cooking is decidedly upscale and gourmet. Tessa prefers healthy, local ingredients. I focus on writing, Hannah&#8217;s photography is breathtaking, and Lauren&#8217;s blog is entirely gluten free. But what brought us together &#8211; and keeps us together &#8211; is our mutual love for food.</p>
<p>From day one, we knew we wanted to create a website. Everything was a group effort, from the concept of The Kitchen Generation to the final launch ten months later. The site will share recipes, stories, photographs, techniques and tips, all from a unique younger perspective.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never met Kam, Lauren, Tessa or Hannah in person, but they&#8217;re some of the best friends I have. We exchange secret santa presents, we talk for hours on Skype. I text them when I&#8217;m having a rough day. This project means so much to us, and we&#8217;re so excited to share it with the world. I hope you take a look, browse around, and get hungry.</p>
