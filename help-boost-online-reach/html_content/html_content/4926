Dr. Oz has become a household name in the USA.&amp;nbsp; And while Dr. Oz advocates many of the practices of conventional medicine, he has a differing opinion of the recently-developed swine flu vaccine. Keep reading to find out why you and your loved ones should think twice before getting this vaccine.",
	"fulltext" => "Dr. Oz has been receiving a flu shot annually for the last ten years.&amp;nbsp; He will also be receiving the swine flu (H1N1) vaccine as well as a condition of his employment. However, Dr. Oz&amp;rsquo;s wife and four children will not be receiving the swine flu vaccine, therefore allowing them to escape the potential health hazards and toxins implicit of the vaccine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is Advocating the Swine Flu Vaccine?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swine flu vaccine is being promoted, especially to pregnant women and children. This is also the same group that is most likely to have negative side-effect that could be the most severe. Who is pushing this vaccine?&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Many physicians have been snookered into believing that the swine flu vaccine is a must and as a result push this vaccine to their clients.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A large number of corporations gladly promote annual flu shots as they fill their pockets with sizable profits from useless vaccines. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has even begun advocating flu vaccination for children five and under.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dangers Involved&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mercury that is contained in vaccinations has been scientifically linked to neurological and brain damage in both adults and children. While the medical industry seems to be blatantly lying and claiming that there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, this is simply not true. In fact, primates that were injected with a single vaccine containing thimerosal exhibited significant neurological impairment compared to those injected with saline solution or with no injection at all. The monkeys received 2 mcgs of ethyl mercury. The standard infant does is 12.5 mcg. Most seasonal flu and the swine flu vaccine contain 25 mcg per adult dose. As if mercury is not a serious enough concern, aluminum is considered to be an ever more serious peril to take note of by many researchers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While colleges, grocery stores, pharmacies, and various other locations are gearing up as sites to allow the public access to these highly promoted vaccinations, the evidence from numerous studies reveal that the vaccines do not reduce flu-related doctor visits and that they produce the same results in children as placebos. There are no conclusive studies to support the claim that these vaccines reduce the number of flu-related deaths in the elderly. The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine reports no decrease in deaths from influenza and pneumonia, although vaccination coverage among the elderly has risen from 15 percent in 1980 to 65 percent now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Dr. Oz suggests that you look at him as an example when you decide whether to get a swine flu vaccine, consider the approach that he is taking with his loved ones instead of the fact that he must be vaccinated for employment purposes.",

It was determined that nutrients found in certain foods and beverages, especially tea, could actually induce our innate immune systems to fight off cancer more effectively, as well as battle the viruses, bacteria, and parasites that cause colds, flu, and other infections. This remarkable discovery led to a renowned study, published in 2003, proving that drinking five to six cups per day of tea boosts, by 500 to 1500%, the ability of an innate immune system component to make interferon gamma. Interferon gamma enables the elimination of virus, bacteria, and parasites that cause illness such as colds, flu, pneumonia, and diarrhea, and have also been found to kill cancer cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bukowski&#039;s landmark study helped usher in the new and exciting field of Immununutrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bukowski has authored over 100 research articles, abstracts, and review articles.
