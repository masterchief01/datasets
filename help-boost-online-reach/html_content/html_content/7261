<td VALIGN=TOP><font size=+2>The Pakistani Rich are Worse than Animals</font>
<br>=========================================
<br><font size=+1>Taimur Rahman</font>
<br><font size=+1>Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even animals have their limits,
but the Pakistani ruling-class,
<br>arguibly the most reactionary ruling-class anywhere in the world (if
not
<br>in the history of the world) are worse than animals.&nbsp; In Muzaffargarh
<br>the worst crime imaginable has occurred.
<p>A boy of low class peasant origin was found sitting in a field next
to a
<br>girl of the feudal family. The boy was twelve years old and the girl
was
<br>about 16.&nbsp; Obviously, these were two kids just playing in the
fields.
<p>The feudal lords of the area, who live with a culture of strictly
<br>segregating their women and themselves from the manual workers were
<br>infuriated by the fact that the two were socialising.&nbsp; Feudal
lords in
<br>Pakistan think of women as property that might become unclean if low
<br>class people come in contact with their Izzat (honour).
<p>So they kidnapped the boy and raped him.
<p>At first they thought that the 12 year boy would not leak the story.&nbsp;
As
<br>it became clear that the boy might leak the story possibly even to
the
<br>police, the feudal lords made another attack on the peasants.
<p>To cover up their earlier deed, they called a meeting of the Jirga
<br>(feudal tribal council) and alleged that the two had been found in
a
<br>"compromising position" and that justice could only be served by the
<br>rule "an eye for an eye".&nbsp; 400 peasants were watching the meeting
of the
<br>Jirga.&nbsp;
<p>The Jirga ordered the father of the girl to bring his 18 year old
<br>daughter (the sister of the boy) to the Jirga.&nbsp; He complied. She
was
<br>taken to a nearby barn and gang raped by four adult men. She was sent
<br>back to her father and parents NAKED.
<p>All the low classes of the village stood-by powerless.
<p>These are the Jirgas and Panchayats that politicians such as Imran Khan
<br>and Karzai (in Afghanistan) so boldy hold up as the model of democracy.
<br>Who order the gang rape of teenagers. Some of the names of those who
<br>committed this crime are: Fayyaz, Manzoor, Allah Ditta, Maulvi Abdul
<br>Razzaq and Mazoor Jatoi. The name of the sixth member could not be
<br>ascertained.&nbsp;
<p>The Punjab police has allegedly arrested some people involved with this
<br>incident. But the fact is that the Punjab police is full of more rapists
<br>than the feudals of Pakistan.&nbsp; In my opinion they have arrested
the
<br>perpetrators of this crime to save them from a possible attack by other
<br>people.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>There are powerful lessons to be learnt from this incident.
<p>First, this teenage girl (just like your daughter or sister) was not
<br>gang raped by&nbsp;
<br>some frustrated group of youngsters acting on their own (not that this
<br>would have made this henious act any less barbaric), but by the TRIBAL
<br>COUNCIL.&nbsp; To further humiliate the poor peasants, she was sent
back home
<br>naked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>This was therefore, a decision taken by the ruling-class against the
<br>poor peasants.&nbsp; Its intention was to "teach them all a lesson".&nbsp;
The
<br>lesson is that the poor are the slaves of the rich ruling-class of
<br>Pakistan.&nbsp; If they mistakenly feel that there is any form of equality,
<br>even socialisation between the rich and the poor, the worst possible
and
<br>most humiliating punishment will be metted out against them.&nbsp;
Even the
<br>Israeli army has to maintain some semblance of democracy and concern
for
<br>human rights in the international media, but the feudal lords of
<br>Pakistan are criminals beyond compare.&nbsp; They are worse than the
<br>zionists.&nbsp;
<p>Therefore, it is abundantly clear that these slave drivers are unwilling
<br>for any form of equality or democracy.&nbsp; Is there any solution
open to
<br>the workers and peasants of Pakistan other than a revolution?
<p>No!&nbsp; The slave holders of Pakistan, who have denied the people
the
<br>opportunity for freedom and justice have themselves sealed the fate
of
<br>the future course of development of Pakistani society.&nbsp; They are
the
<br>ones that should be held responsible for violent revolution.&nbsp;
They have
<br>denied the people any other course of action.&nbsp; The peace-loving
people
<br>have tried every means to achieve some semblance of equality and
<br>democracy but it has always been crushed by the military, the feudals,
<br>and the capitalists.
<p>The time has come for the people of Pakistan to take their destiny into
<br>their own hands. To not wait for the establishment, the police, the
<br>army, the courts, the judiciary, the parliament (which does not exist),
<br>and all these other institutions that are only built to protect the
rich
<br>to "deliver" justice.&nbsp; The time has come for the people to create
a
<br>peoples justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Just like the women of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) are arming
<br>their women, the women of Pakistan should be fully armed to defend
<br>themselves. Not only those who raped the girl, but all those who
<br>participated in anyway in the decision of to rape this girl should
be
<br>given the death sentence.
<p>People talk of non-violence, they say we need reform not revolution.
<br>These are the silly dreams of utopians who are totally disconnected
and
<br>unaware of the reality of the oppression on the ground.&nbsp; They
are
<br>unaware of the barbaric character of the ruling-class of Pakistan.
<p>The first conclusion is that Pakistan needs a peoples-democratic
<br>revolution.&nbsp;
<p>Second, we must ask ourselves, when Pakistan was created it was said
<br>that this was in order to safeguard the Muslims.&nbsp; Have the Muslims
been
<br>safeguarded?&nbsp; On the Khabarnama (news) at 9 pm our government
talks of
<br>the rape of Kashmiri women by the Indian soldiers. Are the working-women
<br>of Pakistan safe from the feudals, police, and army of Pakistan?&nbsp;
It is
<br>said that the rights of self-determination of the Kashmiri people are
<br>not safeguarded.&nbsp; Are the rights of self-determination of the
people of
<br>Pakistan guaranteed?
<p>The answer to all these questions, and many others, is NO!
<br>Today the people of Pakistan are enslaved to the feudals, capitalists,
<br>and the civil military oligarchy.
<p>Therefore, the greatest enemy of the people of Pakistan is not the
<br>Indian aggressor.&nbsp; The Indian aggressor is the greatest enemy
of the
<br>people of India.&nbsp; The greatest enemy of the people of Pakistan
is the
<br>enemy at home.&nbsp; The ruling-class and rich of Pakistan who thrive
on
<br>looting, plundering, and rape.
<p>It is against our own ruling-class that we need to make a
<br>peoples-democratic revolution.
<p>Therefore, I appeal to you:
<p>People of Pakistan, do not be fooled by the nationalist and religious
<br>sloganeering of our ruling-class.
<p>The real enemy of the poor people of Pakistan, the workers and peasants
<br>of Pakistan, the men and women of Pakistan, the Baluchi, Sindhi, Pathan,
<br>Kashmiri, Punjabi is the ruling-class, the class of rich people of
<br>Pakistan.&nbsp;
<p>In what sense can we talk of Independence when our daughters and sisters
<br>raped by jirgas and panchayats.&nbsp; Enough is enough.
<p>Unite the many to fight the few!
<br>Unite the poor to fight the rich!
<br>Unite the people to overthrow the ruling-class!
