<ol>
<li>Bake a cake from a mix or from scratch and cool completely.</p>

<li>Crumble cake into a fine consistency into a large bowl.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP:</span> If the texture is too coarse, you can run it through a food processor.</p>
</li>
<li>Add can of cream cheese frosting or <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/cream-cheese-buttercream-frosting">homemade frosting</a> and blend together using the back of a large spoon. Blend thoroughly.

</li>
<li>Roll mixture into 1.25&#8243; &#8211; 1.5&#8243; size balls and lay on wax paper covered cookie sheet. You may want to periodically rinse and dry your hands off in between.
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGYjdyOlhI/AAAAAAAAALc/2xSHKf9Ir2E/s1600-h/cupcake_pops_04.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGYjdyOlhI/AAAAAAAAALc/2xSHKf9Ir2E/s400/cupcake_pops_04.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5188595980765664786" border="0" /></a></p>
</li>
<li>Cover with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for several hours.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP:</span> You can speed this up by placing in the freezer for about 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>Remove. Begin to shape into cupcakes using a small flower-shaped cookie cutter.  (see below) Take the chilled ball and roll it into more of an oval and then slide into cookie cutter. Push it into cutter until about half fills the cutter and the rest sticks out of the top in the shape of a mound. Then push the shaped cupcake carefully out of the cookie cutter from the bottom. Set  right side up on a wax paper covered cookie sheet.  Continue with remaining balls.

</li>
<li>Once shaped, cover and return to freezer. (5-10 minutes)
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP: </span>You can leave them covered in the refrigerator overnight if you want to do the dipping on the following day.</p>
</li>
<li>While cupcake shapes are chilling, begin to heat up your chocolate bark. </li>
<li> Brown chocolate bark for the bottoms. Pink or white chocolate for the tops.</li>
<li> Follow the instructions on the package for melting. Most recommend heating for 30 second intervals at a time and stirring in between. You can also do the double boiler method.
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGa_9yOllI/AAAAAAAAAL8/F1ziltchBQY/s1600-h/cupcake_pops_09.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGa_9yOllI/AAAAAAAAAL8/F1ziltchBQY/s400/cupcake_pops_09.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5188598669415192146" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGbVtyOlmI/AAAAAAAAAME/1rN-FfGDvoU/s1600-h/cupcake_pops_10.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGbVtyOlmI/AAAAAAAAAME/1rN-FfGDvoU/s400/cupcake_pops_10.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5188599043077346914" border="0" /></a></p>
</li>
<li>When you are ready to dip, remove from freezer and set up another wax paper covered cookie sheet.</li>
<li> Take the cupcake shaped mixture and dip bottoms into the melted chocolate &#8211; just to the point where the mounded shape starts.  Remove from chocolate, turn upside down and wiggle so that the excess starts to slide down slightly. Then lay on the wax paper upside down.  If you want them to be lollipops, then go ahead and insert the lollipop sticks while the chocolate is still wet. Continue with rest of the cupcakes. You can also leave some without the sticks. Theyâ€™re just as cute as Cupcake Bites.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP:</span> Dip end of your lollipop stick in the melted chocolate before inserting into chocolate bottoms. Not sure if this helps a lot, but it couldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">DON&#8217;T</span> &#8211; get water in the chocolate. Make sure your hands are completely dry. Water will cause the chocolate to separate and mess up all your hard work.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGbndyOlnI/AAAAAAAAAMM/jf7uTtz2teA/s1600-h/cupcake_pops_11.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Ifc8wjPbTDI/SAGbndyOlnI/AAAAAAAAAMM/jf7uTtz2teA/s400/cupcake_pops_11.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5188599348020024946" border="0" /></a></p>
</li>
<li>Dry completely. (15-20 minutes)</li>
<li>Once dry, dip the tops of the cupcakes in the pink or white chocolate. You may need to move it around a little to cover all the exposed areas.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP: </span>Let the pink chocolate sit for a few minutes after heating to thicken. This will help it from dripping down the sides of the cupcake.</p>
</li>
<li>Remove  from the pink/white chocolate and turn right side up. You may need to hold and rotate it if there is any excess so that it doesnâ€™t drip down too far.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIP:</span> You can use a toothpick to help cover any areas the melted chocolate didn&#8217;t cover.</p>
</li>
<li>For the Cupcake Bites &#8211; just turn right side up and rest on the wax paper. Then go ahead and put a m&amp;m on the top and add sprinkles while wet.</li>

<li>  For the lollipops, Continue holding and place an m&amp;m on the top and add sprinkles. Let them dry in  a styrofoam block that you  have already poked holes into.</li>
<li>When completely dry, cover the lollipops with small plastic treat bags and tie with a ribbon.</li>

<li> For the Cupcake Bites, place in a candy cup and package in small candy truffle boxes to present individually.</li>

				<p>Bakerella!!! I made your cupcakes yesterday for a party this afternoon and they were a HUGE hit. Although they took a while to prepare, they were worth it. I made two batches, one in chocolate with mini chocolate chips and another in lemon. I also used home made cream cheese frosting. Have you ever done this? </p>
<p>Thank you for sharing such a really versatile and creative recipe. You&#8217;re my hero! </p>
<p>You see the cupcakes I made here:<br /><a href="http://dozenflours.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dozenflours.com/</a></p>

				<p>WOW!  These Cupcake Pops are FABULOUSLY YUMMY- and amazingly cute too!  Thanks so much for your easy to follow instructions and pictures.  My sister and I made them this weekend and everyone loved them so much I am making them again today.  We loved watching you on Martha- how exciting.  We&#8217;ve tried your truffle recipe and cute care bear cupcakes using fondant and both were super tasty and cute.  You&#8217;re amazing!  Keep the pics and recipes coming!!!!  THANKS SO MUCH!</p>

				<p>I love these little cuties! I tried to make your Oreo-Cookie Truffles last night- and they are very good, my co workers love them. BUT mine don&#8217;t look at thing like yours =( What do you use to dip yours? Every time I work with melted chocolate I burn myself and make a huge mess. Nothing looks like it should. =(</p>

<p>heidi &#8211; thanks!</p>
<p>julia &#8211; hope you do. And when is LOST coming back. </p>
<p>giba bina &#8211; you&#8217;re welcome!</p>
<p>kim dover &#8211; WOWâ€¦ thanks. That&#8217;s a lot of work. glad you liked everything so much.</p>
<p>becky &#038; hearts &#8211; good luck tonight!</p>
<p>carla queen &#8211; I use a spoon. Just drop your ball in a bowl of melted chocolate. Then lift it out with a spoon and tap the spoon on the side of your bowl to let the excess chocolate fall off. Then let the covered ball, slide off the spoon onto your wax paper.</p>
<p>tricia &#8211; thank you</p>
<p>blue hare mom &#8211; I agree. These take so much time to decorate. The cake mix is a great option if you&#8217;re in a hurry.</p>
<p>joanh &#8211; let me know if you do.</p>

				<p>Hi Bakerella,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m finally delurking but I&#8217;ve been a fan before your Martha fame!</p>
<p>I made the cupcake bites last Saturday and they were a great hit!  I found it easier to start with the icing in the bowl and gradually add my crumbled cake.  I have plans to experiment with different flavours!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post pics on my blog the next time I make them!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />Ms.P</p>

<p>They didn&#8217;t turn our nearly as well as yours because I couldn&#8217;t find chocolate bark.  Regardless, it was delicious.  I am definitely trying them again (finally got some bark at Walmart!).</p>

				<p>I was wondering&#8230; is it OK to replace the cream cheese frosting for cream cheese only? Or is it possible to make this with your oreo cookies truffle recipe? <br />And congratulations! You looked super great on Martha Stewart and the recipe is super great also! Thanks so much :D</p>

				<p>Ms P &#8211; I&#8217;m glad you had success and I&#8217;d love to see pics next time you make them. Thanks for de-lurking.</p>
<p>alice &#8211; they can take a while. It can take the better part of a day. But you can make them in stages.  You can also make the cake the night before and let it  cool. Then the next day, you can mix, mold, dip and decorate.</p>
<p>lfamily5 &#8211; thanks!</p>
<p>gail &#8211; no problem.</p>
<p>JillyRae &#8211; I&#8217;m going there now.</p>
<p>sugarlens &#8211; so glad you like them!</p>
<p>Isa &#8211; stick with the cream cheese frosting for the cake balls and the cream cheese for the oreo truffles. But, I think you could make the truffles into the same shape as the pops. It&#8217;s worth a try for Oreo Cupcakes,</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been to a couple of different stores and can&#8217;t find any chocolate bark. Before I run off to Michael&#8217;s to buy candy melts instead, would dipping chocolate for fruit also work? Are they the same type of chocolate?</p>

				<p>HI Bakerella</p>
<p>Thanks for all of the cute ideas. I am hoping to make these this weekend with my daughters. Is there a certain brand of cake mix that you prefer over another, or do you make your cakes from scratch?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

				<p>Hi Angie!  I first saw you on Martha&#8217;s show . . . and may I say you seemed like a total TV pro on her show!   I am a total blog addict &#8211; anything lifestyle, home dec, crafting and baking.  So, I&#8217;m thrilled to have found you and your blog.  </p>
<p>I just COULD NOT wait to make your cupcake pops.  I thought the were just the cutest darned thing I&#8217;d ever seen.  I followed your recipe from scratch as shown on Martha&#8217;s website.  They turned out very well, and OMG!!! the taste &#8211; simply decadent!!!!  </p>
<p>I did however have a few slight glitches that I thought maybe you or one of your readers could help out with.  I had trouble &#8211; lots of trouble &#8211; with the batter sticking to the cookie cutter.  So much so, I ended scrapping the whole shaping with the cutter process and shaped them by hand.  They ended looking fine, but didn&#8217;t have the cute little fluted bottoms.</p>
<p>Another issue, or more accurately a big DUH! on my part was I totally spaced on putting the sticks in while the chocolate was still fluid on the cake.  I had poke tiny holes into the hardened chocolate with the tip of a knife.  Well, that didn&#8217;t work!  When I dipped the tops of the cakes into the pink candy melts and set them upright to harden, the little cakes starting slipping down the sticks.  So, big NOTE &#8211; dip the sticks before inserting as mentioned here at your blog, and make sure to stick when before chocolate hardens.  So, mine weren&#8217;t &#8220;pops&#8221;, but just mini-cakes.  </p>
<p>Hubby took a bunch to work and said everyone was raving about the surprise of biting into the crunchy chocolate to reach the super-rich, super-chocolately inside.  </p>
<p>Sorry for the long post!  I just wanted to share my experience with the pops and maybe get some feedback on my little &#8220;sticking issue&#8221;.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe and idea.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll make these again!</p>
<p>Carla</p>

				<p>tina &#8211; I&#8217;m glad she liked it. I wish I could have seen that. Too cute.</p>
<p>anonymous &#8211; I have done scratch and cake mixes. If I use a mix, it&#8217;s usually a Duncan Hines brand. But I haven&#8217;t really compared.</p>
<p>Carla &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry you had trouble with the cutter. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for me to say what was causing that.</p>
<p>Was your cake/frosting mixture smooth when you rolled it or was it lumpy? Did you shape them right away or cover them and keep in the fridge/freezer. You may need to try another cutter. If you come across a crinkle cutter like shown in the post get it and try that one because it works pretty good, too. Also, you could try again with a cake mix and canned frosting. The proportions are pretty reliable.</p>
<p>If you want, send me some pics of your steps the next time you make them and I&#8217;ll try to help more or email me if you have any more ?s.</p>
<p>Kate &#8211; you&#8217;re too kind.</p>
<p>Cindy &#8211; Get some styrofoam blocks at a craft store and wrap it with paper. Then poke holes into it.</p>

				<p>i LOOOOOOVE your cupcake pops.  Can&#8217;t wait to try it.  I was wondering, is it worth it to make red velvet cake from scratch, or is does the cream cheese frosting take over the flavor?  Could I did the chocolate appels?  I can&#8217;t find that chocolate bark at our local store.  Also, how long do these pops stay good for?  How should I store them?  THANKS so much for the wonderful idea.</p>

				<p>Hey Bakerella! Love your blog! I&#8217;ve made the cake balls and they were a big hit. I&#8217;m wondering how far ahead of time you&#8217;ve made them &#8211; or how long they&#8217;ll stay &#8220;fresh&#8221;. I&#8217;m making the cupcakes for a baby shower and I was hoping to make them the weekend before. I have a toddler and I work full time so making them during the week will be difficult. Any suggestions? Have you ever frozen the balls to use at a later time? Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Nguyen Family Circus &#8211; Either is fine. If you can&#8217;t find the bark, check out the links in this post for some other options on ccandy melts you can order online. And, they last for several days &#8211; just keep them in an airtight container.</p>
<p>Leila &#8211; sure you can use the bark instead.</p>
<p>Jordansmomma &#8211; I have eaten them up to a week later and I think they still tasted good. But if you&#8217;re worried. Make it in stages. Cake one night, rolling the next and then dipping on another.</p>
<p>Hillary &#8211; glad you enjoyed them.</p>

				<p>These cupcake pops are amazing, Bakerella!<br />When I first saw them I knew that they&#8217;d make the perfect gift for my cupcake loving friend.</p>
<p>I was unable to find the chocolate bark here in Canada so I planned on using the candy melts. When I dipped the first cupcake I realized that it did not look very good : ( I just ended up dipping the tops and I think that they looked okay because of the fluted bottom.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your next entry!</p>

				<p>anonymous &#8211; they will be very moist after mixing the cake and frosting together. But, the texture should be firm enough so that the balls stay round. Do try to firm them up in the fridge or freezer though. It will help before you start to dip.</p>

				<p>Has anyone helped you yet?  Wish i could, but I haven&#8217;t made them as yet.  I will be making them soon for my grand daughter&#8217;s Fancy Nancy Party.  So, I am interested in how you solve your problem.  Did you go back to make sure that you followed the directions correctly?  You may have to start over, heaven forbid!</p>

				<p>Laurie &#8211; Take a look at the last pic form this post &#8211; it will give you a good idea what they look like inside. They should be moist and &#8220;dough&#8221;- like, but firm enough to keep their rolled ball shape, even without refrigerating. However, If they need to be firmer, put them in the freezer for a little while before you dip. And, if that still doesn&#8217;t work, you can try adding a little less frosting next time. Bit, keep going, I think you&#8217;ll be fine and surprised at how good they taste.  Good luck.</p>
<p>Riccia&#8217;s Creative Spot &#8211; thanks and I&#8217;ll try.</p>
<p>texasgaltech &#8211; thanks for being so sweet. I hope you have luck with yours when you make them.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another tip. For your first try, stick with a box cake mix and ready-made frosting. It will give you a good basis for the texture/proportions. And, make sure the cake is cooked completely and cooled completely before you begin crumbling.  Then, if you decide to make from scratch you can judge better to make alterations on amounts, since recipes differ.</p>

				<p>Anonymous &#8211; I haven&#8217;t tried freezing the pops, but you could bake your cake and then freeze half to be thawed later to make the second batch. just cut your frosting in half too.</p>
<p>ayamc &#8211; sounds so cute.</p>
<p>KrustyTheCat &#8211; Oh good!</p>
<p>Anonymous oh thank you soooo much!!</p>
<p>cndymkr / jean &#8211; sure, I think so. I just like cream cheese frosting with red velvet and I make those most of the time.</p>

				<p>Hi Bakerella!  Love your website!  I am attempting to make your cupcake pops for my daughter&#8217;s birthday, and just wondering if it would be okay to make the cupcake mould and freeze them before putting the icing on them.  I have a small baby and time is of the essence, if you know what I mean. <br />Thanks for your help! <br />cristina :)</p>

				<p>Anonymous &#8211; You could certainly try it. They might even stay ok in the fridge for a day just covered tightly. I don&#8217;t think they would dry out too much. Or you could leave the cake/frosting mixture in the fridge (tightly covered) and then roll them the next day. Once you start dipping in the chocolate, you definitely want to do all of that at one time though.</p>
<p>Heather &#8211; Great score! And thanks for the link. I love how they turned it upside down to make a circus tent.</p>

				<p>I thought these were absolutely adorable and thought they looked simple.  They turned out horrible.  It took all day and they were a pain to make!  Needless to say, everything ended up in the garbage and I wasted a beautiful Saturday.  My time is too precious to putz with stuff like this.  What a disappointment!</p>

				<p>Hi Bakerella,<br />I made these cupcakes yesterday and followed the instructions carefully.  Unfortunately I moulded the cake balls into the moulds but the cake mixture appeared to be far too moist.  I have let them sit in the freezer for almost a day now and am going to get back to them.  Should they still be soft after I take them out of the freezer?? What can I do to harden them up a bit?  Are they supposed to be somewhat soft after having come out of the freezer? Please advise.</p>

				<p>Anonymous &#8211; the frosting and cake mixture will be soft but firm enough to keep its rolled ball shape. After they are rolled, they only need to be in the freezer for a few minutes to get them firm not frozen. When they are firmer it helps them hold the shape of the moulded cupcake better. You also want to put them back in the freezer for a few minutes before you dip. If they are too soft, they will get stuck in the chocolate when you dip. </p>
<p>And if you think they are still to soft overall, you may have too much frosting for the amount of cake. I had this happen to me recently. A cake I bake often did not bake up to the usual height and therefore I used a little less frosting to accomodate.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Nynke &#8211; glad to make you smile.</p>

				<p>Hi bakerella I just made these cupcakes tonight (I just sent you pics) I kept the flower shape instead of molding it into cupcakes. I stuck them in a white ikea pot to present as a bouquet. They came out perfect!! I only made about 25 flowers until I got tired of molding! So I kept the rest as a ball shape and dipped in chocolate. Tastes just as good but not as cute. </p>
<p>I followed the recipe for the cream cheese frosting from martha&#8217;s site and I got over 3 cups. I only added enough frosting to make the cake moist enough to form a ball, about 1 1/2-1 3/4 cups. I would advise everyone having problems with it being too moist or dough like to add the frosting in a little at a time. Thanks for sharing this beautiful recipe!</p>
