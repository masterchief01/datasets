            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you lived in Britain in the 
            19th century and you were suffering from some aches and pains, 
            cramps, sleeping problems or nausea the odds are that you would 
            wander down to your local apothecary, hand over a few pennies or 
            even shillings and take home a bottle of tincture of laudanum. And 
            it worked, so well that Britain was consuming tons of the stuff 
            every year. Women used it to alleviate menstrual pains, stressed 
             
            out businessmen took it to calm them down, nurses served it by the 
            spoonful to babies to ease the pain of teething. Since laudanum was 
            little more than a solution of opium in pure alcohol, and the 
            British were happily downing vast quantities of it, did the country 
            go completely down the pan? Well, not quite, in fact helped along by vast 
            quantities of alkaloid drugs and the fact that few of them ever drew 
            a sober breath after the age of six the British went out and built 
            the biggest empire that the world has ever seen.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, there was a 
            major problem with laudanum. There were many different manufacturers 
            with many different quality standards, some excellent and some 
            downright criminal, so the purity of the drug varied enormously 
            which meant that 
            it was very difficult deciding just what was a correct dose and what 
            was an excessive one. Add this to the fact that (a) the alkaloids in 
            opium are very highly poisonous, and (b) basing the &#39;medicine&#39; on alcohol 
            made it incredibly popular, countless numbers of happy imbibers took 
            just a little too much and ended up dead.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There was no such problem with 
            another popular drug, marijuana, which worked very well indeed for a 
            similar list of complaints and, since it was smoked rather than 
            ingested, the effect was almost instantaneous. Far from being 
            poisonous however, there has never been a recorded case of anyone 
            dying of marijuana poisoning, and it has been calculated that a user 
            would have to to smoke approximately half a ton of cannabis within 
            about 10 minutes in order to absorb a fatal dose. The slight flaw in 
            the ointment was that many people found it a little bit too 
            relaxing, and got into the habit of lying back smoking weed instead 
            of working to pay their taxes and support their families so, hardly 
            surprisingly, it was banned during the early 20th century, and it is 
            probably a complete coincidence that Britain lost its empire before 
            that century was out!</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">What could not be ignored 
            however was that cannabis had certain medical advantages which had 
            been recognized for about 4000 years, but health services throughout 
            the world could hardly give people suffering from pain a handful of 
            dried leaves to smoke so eventually the active psychotic ingredient 
            in marijuana, THC, was isolated and then manufactured 
            synthetically. Unfortunately it did not work as well as smoking the 
            leaf, possibly because the cannabis plant contains many other 
            alkaloids as well as THC and it is possible that these were having a 
            synergistic effect. It was not long before people suffering from 
            cancer or multiple sclerosis were being hauled before the courts for 
            smoking marijuana in order to ease their pains or the nausea 
            caused by chemotherapy. The government, many of whose members I 
            suspect had sampled marijuana in their youth, eventually downgraded 
            the penalties for possession and use of the drug.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Is this an argument for the 
            complete legalisation of cannabis? No. There are definite provable 
            links between cannabis use and psychosis, although to be fair it is 
            reasonable to ask which came first; did psychotic people take up 
            cannabis for recreational use or did recreational use of cannabis 
            cause psychosis? Statistics can of course be used to prove any 
            argument whatsoever. The fact that it is an illegal drug in most 
            countries of the world however makes it very difficult indeed to 
            collect meaningful statistics on the medical benefits as well as the 
            undesirable side-effects of cannabis use, and the only positive statement 
            that we can make is that for the relief of many very distressing 
            symptoms it works, works quickly, and side-effects are usually 
            minimal and non toxic.</font></p>
