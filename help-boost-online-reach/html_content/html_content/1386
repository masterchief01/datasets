<p>Friends built the <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ka2kpzTAL8">Alton Brown flower pot smoker</a> a few months back and then visited this weekend and convinced me to build one for the Fourth.</p>

<p><strong><br />
Getting the parts</strong></p>

<p>While the actual construction of the smoker is trivial, I found that gathering all of the needed items was challenging.  Many of the items were hard to source.  If you live in Seattle, the guide below should help tremendously.  Generally speaking, I would recommend that you try ordering everything but the Pot, Bowl and bricks online.</p>


<p><strong>Pot size selection</strong></p>

<p>The two hardest to source parts drive pot size selection.  The terra cotta bowl is hard to find.  The 17&#8221; bowl is the largest I was able to find anywhere.  It is also really heavy so it is impractical to order online.</p>

<p>However, if you can find an 18&#8221; bowl, I would be pretty tempted to get an 18&#8221; pot.  You can definitely fit the Weber 22.5&#8221; replacement charcoal grate in the pot (it is actually about 17&#8221;) or possibly even the 18.5&#8221; grill grate (it is slightly less than 18&#8221; in actual diameter).  Not only would you get more cooking surface, but you&#8217;d also have a much easier to source grate.</p>


<p style="clear:left;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts List</strong></p>

<table><tr><td>Item</td><td>Price</td><td>Source</td><td>Comments</td></tr><tr><td>17&#8221; Terra Cotta Pot</td><td>$19</td><td>Home Depot</td><td>They had these at City Peoples, but I didn&#8217;t stop there until later.</td></tr><tr><td>17&#8221; Terra Cotta Bowl</td><td>$22</td><td><a href="http://www.citypeoples.com/gardenstore/index.html">City Peoples Garden Store</a></td><td>Hard to find. Try garden / nursery stores. I think it is also called an azalea bowl. Some <a href="http://www.twothirds.org/2005/09/26/smoking-pot-a-cheap-terracotta-flower-pot-smoker-ala-alton-brown/">people use saucers</a> that they drill into.</td></tr><tr><td>Heat Element</td><td>$10</td><td><del datetime="2011-03-29T17:18:53+00:00"><a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=100722&amp;#038;navAction=jump&amp;#038;navCount=8&amp;#038;skuid=sku350528&amp;#038;id=prod350527">Walgreens</a></del> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A2ZTS">Amazon</a></td><td><del datetime="2011-03-29T17:18:53+00:00">There are reports of insufficiently sized heat elements.

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A2ZTS">Maxi-Matic <span class="caps">ESB</span> 300X</a> is nearly identical to the Walgreens element I originally used.

Unfortunately, they don&#8217;t fit. Order a 16&#8221; grate online well in advance.  I ended up using a more expensive &#8216;grill topper&#8217;</td></tr><tr><td>Grill Thermometer</td><td>$14</td><td>Sutter Home &#038; Hearth</td><td>Shockingly hard to find. Try ordering online.</td></tr><tr><td>Pan (for wood chips)</td><td>unk</td><td>our kitchen</td><td>Should be easy to find.  Get as heavy a pan as possible.</td></tr><tr><td>Ceramic Pot feet</td><td>$6</td><td>Stoneway Hardware</td><td>These are pretty easy to find elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>3 Bricks</td><td>$1.50</td><td>Home Depot</td><td>Could be 2&#215;4s or anything else to get the smoker above the base.</td></tr><tr><td>5 lb Pecan Wood Chunks</td><td>$15</td><td>Sutter Hearth &#038; Home</td><td>Plan ahead and consider ordering online. I later found Apple and Cherry chunks at <a href="http://www.stonewayhardware.com/">Stoneway hardware</a> for much less. We used about 2/3 of the wood.</td></tr></table>

<p><strong>Getting the Heat Element controls out of the smoker</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to get the controls for the heat element outside of the smoker so that I could adjust the heat without opening the smoker.  This approach had the added advantage of getting the plastic base (and overheat sensor) out of the hot pot. This was shockingly easy to do.  These instructions are for the Walgreens hot plate which seems to be pretty commonly used (I&#8217;m assuming that you&#8217;re smart enough not to plug in the hot plate):</p>


<ol>
<li>Remove the screw that connects the burner to the plastic base.  There is just one screw and its in the middle of the burner at the top.</li>
<li>Disconnect the wires from the heat element.  They are meant to be easily disconnected and reconnected. All you need to do is press the tab and pull the wire and connector off of the pin.</li>
<li>Place some foil (or preferably a non-conductor) over the exposed base to catch any drippings that may fall out of the pot (we had none escape).  Keep the foil clear of the control element.</li>
<li>Center the hot plate base amongst the bricks (see photo) and run the wires up the hole in the bottom. Reconnect them to the heat element. I don&#8217;t think it matters, but the fat wire was originally connected to the prong that runs to the center of the heat element.</li>
</ol>



<p>I used both bricks and the pot holder feet so that I could raise the smoker up off the base plate and allow air to flow up through the hole in the pot. I then placed a brick in bottom of the smoker to support the heat element and keep the electrical prongs off the base of the pot.  I had to chip the corners of the brick so that it could sit to the side of the hole for air flow.</p>

<p>Obviously, the wiring is much more exposed than it was in the sealed hot plate.  It is actually very hard to touch the wires during operation, but be careful.  Also, I&#8217;d highly recommend you ensure that you&#8217;re plugged into a <span class="caps">GFCI </span>protected outlet (all outdoor outlets in buildings built after the mid-eighties are required to be <span class="caps">GFCI </span>protected).</p>

<p><strong>Temperature management and monitoring</strong></p>

<p>The temp at the top of the grill does a good job telling the temp inside the smoker.  We kept wireless temp probes in the meat throughout the process.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.naffziger.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/temperature.jpg'><img src="http://www.naffziger.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/temperature.jpg" alt="" title="temperature" width="500" height="218" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-389" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Metal smokers vs. the Flower Pot vs. the Big Green Egg</strong></p>

<p>You can buy a metal smoker from Wal-mart or other sources for less than you&#8217;ll spend assembling the flower pot smoker.  I&#8217;ve never cooked with a metallic smoker, but based on other comments I&#8217;ve read the inexpensive ones are thin and shed heat tremendously quickly.</p>

<p>When we were finished smoking the internal temp was about 210.  Two hours later it was 140.  Four hours later it was still warm to the touch.  The Terra Cotta simply holds the heat really well.  The ambient air was in the sixties with a strong wind on our roof deck.</p>

<p>However, the flower pot is no match for the Big Green Eggs.  These ceramic smokers are massive.  The equivalent size to the flower pot is probably the Large Egg, which has an 18&#8221; diameter cooking area, weighs 140 lbs and retails for $700. Plus I can&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;d have had as much fun as I did figuring the flower pot smoker out.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe</strong></p>

<p>We cooked two 4.5lb Boston Butts on the 4th using Alton Brown&#8217;s <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_23019,00.html">recipe for the brine and rub</a>.  It turned out fantastically well.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
Hamilton posted a series of <a href="http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2008/07/05/the-alton-brown-flower-pot-smoker/img_41601/#comment-4914">really good questions</a> alongside one of the photos, and I wanted to include the questions and my responses here as I think they&#8217;ll help other people:</p>



<blockquote>I was wondering if you think it would be feasible to run a second Walgreen&#8217;s burner through that bottom hole and into the pot.  This may give me the potential for more heat and heat control in the winter months when the weather is a little cooler here in South Carolina. Maybe stagger them in the pot (one above the other.)  Or even side by side standing up.</blockquote>



<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll need to do this.  We had trouble keeping the heat down in the target 220 range and never had the dial anywhere near the halfway point.  By the end of the session, I don&#8217;t think the dial would go any lower.</p>

<p>Also, these are 1000W burners (9 Amps).  Many household circuits are 15 Amps (some are 20), so you&#8217;d run the risk of blowing a fuse if you plugged them into the same circuit. </p>

<p>However, if you did do it, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d want to stagger them as the heat from the lower one may melt the solder on the higher one.  Side by side would work, but you&#8217;d need something else to set the grate on.</p>




<blockquote>Also, when you disconnect the burner from the base, do you have enough length in the wire to connect the burner back to the burner once you&#8217;ve run it through the hole with the original connections or do I need to buy some extension wires?
</blockquote>



<p>It is tight, but there is enough wire.  If you do need to get wire, make sure it is thermally insulated.</p>




<blockquote>What was the highest temp you were able to see in your cooker?</blockquote>



<p>We accidentally let it rise to around 240 (220 is the target).  At some point I&#8217;ll do a controlled test, but it could definitely go much higher.</p>



<blockquote>Do you soak your wood chips as well as leave water in the bottom of the pan?  When do you like to put the chips in the cooker - When the cooker comes up to temp?</blockquote>



<p>We used chunks instead of chips as they are less likely to actually catch fire.  I&#8217;ve read that you don&#8217;t need to soak them, but a friend advised to soak half. This way, the dry ones start smoking early and the wet ones start smoking later.  So, you don&#8217;t need to lift the top until later in the cooking process (lifting the top lets out the smoke and cools everything slightly).</p>



<blockquote>Do you end up adding more chips to the pan throughout the cooking process?  If so, what is your advice for removing the grill surface and the meat?</blockquote>



<p>We added wood once (and only opened the top twice). The second time we lifted the top was to rotate the butts.  The meat can be easily removed using foil and oven mitts.  We had a plate with foil on the side to set them on.</p>

<p>If you look carefully at the picture of the butts you&#8217;ll see two screws sticking up through the cooking surface.  We gripped the screws with oven mitts and lifted it directly out (it did take a bit of effort as it was kind of jammed down there).</p>



<blockquote>To remove the upper pot/lid, have you come up with a good &#8220;handle&#8221; or do you have an alternative method?  As your graph shows, I guess it&#8217;s a little hot and awkward to fooling around with when it&#8217;s that hot.</blockquote>


<p>It shockingly isn&#8217;t too hot to touch. The lid measurements are from the interior.  The exterior of the terra cotta is definitely cooler.  Some people claim that they can use their bare hands, I just used oven mitts, but used my hands to make minor adjustments.</p>



<blockquote>Would it be beneficial to drill more holes in the bottom of the pot to let in more fresh air or do you think that would let too much heat out?</blockquote>



<p>I don&#8217;t think you want to do this.  You don&#8217;t want the wood to burn (heavy air flow), you want it to combust enough to smoke.  We had absolutely no problems with air flow.</p>

<p>I was able to find most of  my materials today at Lowe&#8217;s (terra cotta pots 2 @ $24.97), True Value Hardware (grill surfaces, cast iron smoker box for the wood chips, and the meat thermometer = total $42), and Walgreen&#8217;s (single eye burner $9.99.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow I start!</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a terra cotta bowl, so I&#8217;m gonna start with a second pot of equal/exact size to use as my lid.</p>
<p>I also bought some 4-5 inch tall terra cotta pots to flip upside down and use as the legs for my cooker.  This should give ample space for the burner base.</p>
<p>The grill surfaces I bought were the ones that actually go in the bottom of a standard, circular shaped (kettle-style) Weber grill.  The ones I bought are designed to hold the charcol not the meat.  Therefore they are built of steel as opposed to aluminim of whatever cheap material they always use.  </p>
<p>As soon as I can find the time to start on all of this, I will.</p>

<p>I tried using the charcoal grate, but it didn&#8217;t fit in my smoker.  I spoke with a guy at the BBQ store and he told me that both the charcoal grate and cooking grate are made of steel, but the cooking grate has been chromed.  The chrome will eventually fleck off over time (and end up in your food), so the charcoal grate would be just fine.</p>

<p>Some things i altered:</p>
<p>I bought some weber roasting/drip pans from my local hardware store.  8.5 x 11 inch pans.  I used one on my bottom charcol grate by as a drip pan to keep anything from dripping on my burner.  I filled this pan with half of an inch of water.</p>
<p>I cut out a section of another roasting pan exactly the size of my burner and placed it directly on the burner.  I then put my cast iron smoker box directly on the cut out roasting pan.  I found that if I didn&#8217;t do this, the cast iron smoker box put out a foul smelling odor as whatever it was coated with during production was burning off when it was directly on the burner without the cut out foil to seperate them.</p>
<p>I bought 4 stainless U bolts to use as handles when removing the grill grates during the process of adding chips.</p>
<p>Something i would like to change&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>Adding chips during the cooking process is a pain in my ass.  In the time needed to disassemble the cooker to get to the bottom, my temp drops to 170 or so by the time I get it put back together.  Need to find a way to pull out my smoker box through the side of the pot.  Any suggestions?  Can I cut the pot?  i iwould need to find a way to do that so I could slide my smoke box out, do the exchange, and slide it back in quickly.  I would want it to seal back up tight so as to not lose too much heat.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-4924" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Nice thinking on putting something between the cast iron smoking box and the burner.  What did you use to cut the pan?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also read a few posts that suggested using a water pan as it helps to serves as a heat reservoir, reducing temperature fluctuations.  I was surprised by how little fat dripped off the two butts that I cooked.</p>
<p>What temp did you cook at?</p>
<p>How often did you have to replace the chips? Is it possible that they caught on fire and burned up quicker? I only had to replace the chunks I used once and still had plenty of wood left to burn when I stopped smoking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reluctant to cut into the pot.  About 80% of the pots at Home Depot of this size had cracks in them so I presume that they are more fragile than they seem.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m off to our second annual J&amp;K Rib cookoff classic tomorrow. It&#8217;s just a few highschool soccer buddies finding a way to hang out. Last year, I took my New Braunfels smoker up in the back of my truck and smoked up some very tasty ribs. It was only my second run at them and they turned out great. Unfortunatly, the judges did not like to spice that we like down here in south (central) Texas. Most were from Dallas. </p>
<p>This year I have to either leave the cayanne behind or take a large box of tampons for the judges. </p>
<p>Anyway, I got started on this clay pot smoker about 2 weeks ago. I have had trouble finding a hot plate that would do the trick. I ended up with a fryer since it went to 1500 Watts and could hold the wook nicely. The non coil style hot plates at 1200 Watts would only get me up to 160F. The fryer only gets it to about 170-175. I am planning on converting to the Walgreens special. Walmart was out of hot plates at the time due to hurricane Ike. Funny thing is, I could walk to a Walgreens but never gave it a shot. I&#8217;m checking in tomorrow before I leave. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to wing it a little and use the new hot plate on competition day. I can&#8217;t wait to see my friends faces when I put my pot together to start the competition. They are going to crack up and give me hell. The conversation alone will be priceless.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let ya&#8217;ll know how it goes. </p>

<p>Many of the hot plates have some fail-safe that triggers if the base gets too hot. That&#8217;s probably why you&#8217;re seeing your temp up to 160-175. Two solutions to the problem are to: 1. get your base out of the pots, or 2. figure out the heat sensing mechanism and disable it.  The Walgreens plate is super easy to take apart plus you get the benefit of controls outside the pot.</p>
<p>Happy smoking!</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-4973" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I just built one of these 2 weeks ago and couldn&#8217;t be happier. Found just about everything at Home Depot. I ended up going with a slightly oversized top to help reduce the smoke leakage. Alton gives specifics in his Essential Kitchen Tools book, but for me it came down to finding the right size pot, lid and grill. I think I&#8217;ve got a 16&#8243; bottom base with a 18&#8243; top pot, but it looks essentially the same as the ones pictured. </p>
<p>After experimenting, I found that it helps for consistent temperature if you pre-heat the flowerpot for about 20 minutes prior to popping in the wood chips. Once the pottery is warm the temperature stays consistent. </p>
<p>PS: Thanks for the tip on getting the controls outside of the smoker. That&#8217;s a great idea &#8211; I kept trying to adjust from the top with a stick &#8211; didn&#8217;t work.</p>

Problem was that there were a lot of drippings &#8211; well, that&#8217;s kind of a good thing, but 1) it kept dousing some of the wood chunks, acutally soaking some to the point of their going out. and 2) I believe that the smoke from the fat drips is supposed to be carsonegenic &#8211; pretty bad for you. The design of the flowerpot smoker makes it impossible to avoid the drippings, so I&#8217;m wondering if anyone has ever experimented with a drip pan or something to keep the drips off of the coals? I&#8217;ve been thinking of hanging a small catch tray from my Webber under the grill, but would like to hear if anyone else has any thoughts, ideas or solutions.</p>

<p>Hanging the catch tray sounds like a pretty good idea, but you&#8217;ll need to be careful when removing the grate to add wood chunks.  Alternatively, you could also place a smaller grate in the pot that sits above the wood chunks and rest your dripping pan on that.</p>

It catches most of the drippings and protects the ham from drying out on the flat side that is facing the element.  I put my wood chips right on the hot plate burner with no pan.  I found that a pan setting on the hot plate will bring the temprature down too low, as it makes the hot plate cycle prematurely.    Otherwise I let the jucies from what ever I am cooking just drip right down on the buner and the bottom of the pot and drain onto a pan underneath the pot.   I have done this now for 4 years and never had a short.  After I finish smoking and it all cools down, I unplug and pull the hot plate out and scrape the residue build up off the plate and under the coils with a screwdriver.  I have smoked hundreds of hours before the hot plate had to be replaced because of rusting of the metal base under the coil fo the hot plate.  I get my hotplates at Walgreens $9.95.   Replacing once every year or two.</p>

I followed Alton&#039;s episode to the T minus the teracotta bowl (simply couldn&#039;t find a well-stocked garden center in January) and made pulled pork for the superbowl. I also decided to cook on a bone-piercing cold day: -3 with the windchill, 15 degree air temp. I did it in an empty garage w/ventillation. I could get the smoker empty up to 230 degrees. Once the pork went in, though, it never got above 200. It coasted at 185-190 most of the time and I had to finish in the oven because my cook time was going to push me to about 2 in the morning at that rate. The outside temperature was simply too cold and the plate could not keep up.  Some exterior parts of the pot were barely warm to the touch, others out of the path of the heat was even cold. The garage was barely a shelter, just for the wind. Changed the wood once during the smoking. </p>
<p>If I had the time (and woken up at 4 am) I could have done the whole thing in the smoker, but I can&#039;t wait for a warmer day to give this a go. Knowing that it will perform in the dead of winter, I will be able to start working with this thing when it gets back to 35-40 degrees instead of -3.</p>

About 16 hours total. It seems you cant overcook the meat. My next experiment is a digital temperture controller attached to the burner. Thanks for the nice site Dave</p>

I used a diamond blade in a 4&quot; angle grinder to cut a circle through the base of the bottom pot..  It cut easily, and I haven&#039;t had any problems with cracking.  I mounted the lower pot on a frame, and the electric burner is held such that the base is outside the pot but the element is inside.  This allows me to lower the burner and wood pan out of the smoker to add wood.   I also mounted a woven fireplace gasket strip to the lip of the top pot.  This gives a pretty good seal, and it minimized the chances of chipping either pot when removing or replacing the top.</p>

A couple of things. I had to rewire the heat element for the wires to be long enough for the element to sit on two bricks. I need to get some better heat-resistant wire, though. I used a combination of applewood chips and apricotwood chips&#8230;delicious! but I had to add chips every 1 &#8211; 1.5 hours. I will get wood chunks next time. I ended up smoking a 6 lb. Boston butt for 11 hours.<br />
Also, I found an 18&quot; pot at Lowes and an 18&quot; &quot;lid&quot; pot at Swanson&#039;s in Seattle. With these, there is a Weber charcoal grill grate that fits perfectly on the lip of the pot, so it&#039;s always level.<br />

<p>Daniel: I wouldn&#039;t recommend brining ribs since the lean/fat ratio is pretty high in the first place. Second, smoke from hickory chips/chunks can be pretty bitter if overzealously applied. What did you do for the rub on the ribs? Also, how long did you smoke them for?</p>

The hickory did make the food very bitter.<br />
When i tried the plain un-brined rub free meet it was not only bitter but salty too. And no salt was added.<br />
Which wood would you reccomend for next time, i refuse to five up?<br />
It did take me a while to get the temp right.  It took like 2 hours to get over 150 degrees<br />
The pie pan i bought also partially disintegrated.<br />
So i cooked the ribs for about 1.5 hours and they were dredful.  tender yes but overcooked and tasted like charcoal<br />
the pork shouldder cooked for about 6 hours, keep in mind i used haldf a shoulder, cause since i could not find a bouwl a bought a saucer and it seemed to fit with half a shoulder.<br />
The shoulder after 7 hours was very darken,  on the outside and it also tasted like charcoal but when i went to cut it it was tough and the hickory taste made it uneatable.<br />
Ill post some pics a bit later to show u how it came out .</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5348" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Too much fun!  Never even heard of these until yesterday, and now I have one heating up in my yard.  So here&#039;s  my take:  </p>
<p>I also could not find a bowl, so used a saucer. Spoke to the Home depot guy, who said I didn&#039;t need a masonry bit to drill terra cotta&#8211;just go slow and keep it wet.  (I poured 1/2&quot;  water in the bottom of the saucer and drilled through it.)   One center hole, two side holes, through which I placed screws to attach  drawer pulls.  They run a little loose in the holes, but since I pick up that slack when I pick up the lid, I&#039;m not worried about it.  Used some of the shaped wire handles rather than solid block&#8211;look nice, and may dissipate heat better.  Also that slack space would leave room for a thermal break if I wanted to drill a small block of wood and put that between handle and lid.  Another thought&#8211;threaded rod instead of a screw would have allowed me to put a set of handles on top and bottom&#8211;right side up when less room/more heat retention desirable; inverted when I want more hight over my meat.   Also, big washers would be a smart thing to have under the screw heads to distribute the weight.  I didn&#039;t say I *had* them, just that it would be smart . . .  </p>
<p>No Walgreens around, bought a ceramic-topped, metal-sided GE cookplate (w/two-year warranty included) at Walmart.  Trying it first w/the whole unit inside the flowerpot.  If that doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;ll either dissemble it or cut the pot and lower it over the unit as described by Peter above.   </p>
<p>So the base is in the pot, cord run out through bottom hole.  On top of cookplate is a single-layer-cake round pan&#8211;a little stouter than the pie plate, and straight sides to impede air flow less, hold more chips.  Layer above that is a thrift-store find&#8211;a round &quot;stove-top grill&quot;, the two-piece kind consisting of a chrome ring w/a drip tray, and a round cooking surface that is slotted around the outside, and fits on top of the chrome ring.  The slots go over the drip tray, so nothing goes on the burner or into the chip pan below.  I had to arrange the chip pan off to the side a bit, to allow for free flow of air from below, or that drip ring would have impeded it.   Not only does this catch drips, it serves as a water reservoir, and the cooking surface could in theory be used for searing, holding potatoes for baking, etc.  Who knows?   </p>
<p>Then above that is my steel charcoal grate, which I plan on using for a cooking surface, obviously.  Above that is an adjustable rectangular grate section, which I expanded to fit on the inner lip about four inches down from the top of the pot.  Could be used to hold things for warming, cook on, removed if not needed, etc.  </p>
<p>Wah lah.  (I hope.)   The whole arrangement  looks pretty spif, anyway.  Just checked it, and the grills are hot, warm, and warm-ish respectively, from bottom up.  No smoke yet.  Also occurs to me that when the winter winds are howling, there would be no reason not to use this as a slow-cooker in my sunroom (sans chips).   Taking that warranty out for a test-drive . . .  </p>
<p>Work in progress, but I&#039;m liking my set up so far.  </p>
<p>Regarding replenishing chips, I&#039;ve read that you don&#039;t need to have smoke throughout the whole cooking process, and that too much (esp. hickory) can make the meat bitter.  So if the temp is good, there really shouldn&#039;t be much need to get in there and fiddle.  Will probably try the u-bolts in the grate and the cooking surface on the stove-top grill just &#039;cuz, but a step at a time.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5399" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for the informative tutorial.  Put together the smoker yesterday and gave it a spin. Two small issues to throw out there: </p>
<p>I was not being able to find the top portion, the terra cotta bowl.  I purchased a saucer since they were readily available and used 3/8&quot; masonry bit to drill a hole for the thermometer.  The saucer works fine but it leaks a lot of smoke.  Does the bowl keep a much better seal?  My project today is trying to come up with some type of seal.  I&#039;m sure some duct tape along the outside would work fine, but not very practical if you want to open it every hour or two. </p>
<p>The other difference was the hotplate.  It&#039;s still $9.99 at Walgreen&#039;s but the base now is a rectangle, not a circle.  It made fitting the base underneath the pot more of a challenge.  I also had to remove a rubber piece from the base that stops the plug wire from moving.  I needed to slide more cord up through the base to make the connection to the heating element. </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

The previous poster is right about Walgreens changing the hotplate to square.  Mine fit without any extra work, but it&#039;s very tight.  The interesting part is it almost seems sturdy enough to support the whole unit by itself, but I think that might create airflow problems. </p>
<p>I will also say I was extremely frustrated trying to find non hickory/mesquite wood chunks in Las Vegas, but I finally found a place way out in the boonies.  The author isn&#039;t kidding about checking online well in advance! </p>
<p>What approximate temperature should the meat thermometer read when the pork is &quot;done?&quot;  The full 210-220?</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5401" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#039;ve made a couple of changes to mine.  First, I put a fireplace woven gasket around the rim of the cover, mostly to cushion it a bit when I put the lid on.  Don&#039;t use the gasket adhesive, as it&#039;s too thin for this application.  Use regular silicone adhesive.  I also put an aluminum drip pan under the grill.  This catches most of the liquid from a shoulder.  I hang it from the grill using some thick copper wire.  My second hot plate died.  This is a weak point of the design.  I took the coil out and mounted it on a terracotta plate by drilling two holes through the plate.  I connected a 1000 watt rheostat to the hot line and pluged the cord into a gcfi outlet.  This allows constant heat instead of the on/off heating cycle of the regular hotplate. This has been working really well, but please don&#039;t do this if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing.</p>

<p>Two ideas for this (one of which I have actually used&#8230;)   </p>
<p>To reduce the need to add chips, I use several containers of chips and water, with different amounts of water in each container.  If you get it right, as one container is used up, the next one boils away and dries enough to start smoking.   </p>
<p>As for sourcing cooking grates&#8211;Would  <a href="http://www.akitchen.com/store/screens-pizza.html" target="_blank">pizza screens</a> work?   (no connection with the link, just the first relevant result I could find on Google)  Bigger restaurant supply places have them in 1 inch increments, and most have all the even sizes, up to 18 inches.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5440" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi all.  I just sourced the parts for Alton&#039;s terracotta smoker and did a first run temperature test.  Here are some observations: </p>
<p>For those having trouble sourcing the tops, try pottery wholesale outfits.  I had the same trouble finding an 18-inch bowl for the top.  I stumbled into a wholesale supplier listing on the web that pointed me to the Washington Pottery Company in Kent, WA.  Some of these wholesale places sell to the public, but don&#039;t advertise this fact. </p>
<p>As for temperatures, be careful with the thermometer.  I had an older oven thermometer lying around and used it at first.  I decided to use an instant-read probe thermometer to calibrate the oven thermometer.  It turns out the oven thermometer was consistently reading about 50 &deg;F lower than the digital probe thermometer.  I had previously calibrated the digital unit with both ice water and boiling water (I am at sea level or very near so, so I did not correct for altitude).  I got a new grill thermometer from Lowe&#039;s that rests directly on the grill.  After some control knob tweaking on the hotplate, I eventually got pretty good agreement between the digital probe sticking in the hole of the lid and the grill thermometer.  I used the oven thermometer to plug the hole on the top bowl and to secure the probe. </p>
<p>One last comment.  I read previous posts from people using water in their smokers to catch drips.  I think we are seeking dry heat in these units.  If too much steam is generated (depending on water volume and oven temp), it may interfere with the smoking process.  Either way, the meat will cook just fine.  I think only the smoking efficiency will be affected by adding water to the process.</p>

I had a 8lb pork shoulder cut in half and smoked both pieces in about 6 hrs.  Internal temp was around 170, ideally I would have liked to have smoked the butt for 9 hrs and waited for the internal temp to get to 190 but people were getting ansy and it was already 9:30P&#8230;:).  I prepared the rub and the brine just like Alton brown did and it turned out great.  I also used applewood chips soaked in water since I couldn&#8217;t find any chunks.</p>
<p>My biggest problem was getting the temperature steady around 210, I tried using a wet towl to create a seal around the plate/pot, that helped a little bit.  </p>

<p>I&#039;ve burned up 2-3 hot plates and am getting ready to go the burner-only route. I already have the 1,000watt rheostat. How did you mount the burner to the plate (is there a spacer) and how do you allow for air flow. Would you be willing to post some photos to help others who are struggling to solve the hot plate issue? </p>
<p>My plan in the future is to smoke the Boston Butt with a couple of pans-worth of chunks, then move the butt to an oven indoors to finish the process to keep the fat and collagen from dripping into the smoker base. </p>

Has anyone tried to replace the electric burner with a gas burner, preferably using the small Coleman canisters?  It would make this smoker great for car camping.  There are portable smokers for around $235 that feed wood disks into the burner and divert the smoke to racks of meat under a foil cover.  I would think the heat retention in the terra cotta pots would work much better, as long as you could heat it up and then control the temp with a low-enough burn.  Anyone try this or otherwise rule it out?</p>

I think I over smoked it; the outside skin had a very bitter&#8230; almost acrid aftertaste (yet the inside meat was very tasty). After doing a little research at The Smoke Ring it seems like a lack of exhaust caused the bitter aftertaste. I know that drilling holes in the lid would allow for better exhaust, but do you think that would affect the smoker&#039;s ability to maintain a constant temperature?</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5741" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#039;m in Denver and I just made one of these today. Total cost, about $70.<br />
$10 for the hotplate at Walgreens.<br />
I got the 18.5&quot; pot for $14.99 on sale at Lowes. I couldn&#039;t find the azalea bowl anywhere, nor a pot plate, so I went with a hose bowl that was on sale for $20.<br />
Also got the 18&quot; grill for $11 and temperature gauge for $9 at Home Depot.<br />
Three bricks were $1.50, three ceramic feet were $1.99. </p>
<p>There is a hole in the bowl for the hose to come out and connect to a spigot. I&#039;m not sure if that will be a problem or not. If so, I&#039;ll have to cover it with something. At some point I&#039;ll find the correct bowl top, and a 16&quot; grill that sits lower in the pot.<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure the hotplate is different from the ones you guys have been using. There wasn&#039;t enough cable to keep the base outside and the element inside. Also, there are ceramic tabs that hang down under the element about one inch, without the base these would break. However, I was able to disconnect the temperature control and run this on the outside under the pot. It doesn&#039;t stick all the way out, but it&#039;s not too difficult to reach. At some point I&#039;ll extend the wiring and maybe make a control box for it. </p>
<p>I also picked up a bag of hickory chunks. The only other thing I could find this time of year was mesquite chips and I wanted the chunks. I can&#039;t wait to try it out.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5880" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Part 1:<br />
First of all let me thank Dave Naffziger for having the best reference (by far) on the web for the flower pot smoker. I referred to Dave&rsquo;s information many times when setting up my smoker, and to the on-going discussion to which I am happy to now contribute. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just about got this flower pot smoker thing perfected, finally. Below are my notes to myself about how I did it. These are not instructions and I accept no responsibility for any injury or damages that may result from anyone else doing what I did. </p>
<p>To cure the problem of destroying hot plates, I mounted a hot plate burner to a terra cotta saucer using wires gutted from the Walgreen&rsquo;s 1000Watt hotplate. The spacers I used to raise the burner off the saucer are 6/32 washers. This raises the contacts of the burner off the floor of the flower pot. I made three &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;  &frac14;&rdquo;, or so, thick using silicon caulk and placed them on the inside bottom of the base flower pot to set the saucer on to allow air flow. This setup provides a constant flow of cool air passing by the wires. I have had no hot plate problems since coming up with this arrangement.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5881" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Part 2: I cut the handle off a seven inch cast iron fry pan to put the wood chunks in instead of a metal pie plate. I used a masonry blade in my skill saw to cut the handle. I feel the cast iron skillet heats more evenly than the steel pie plate and provides a more complete use of wood chunks. </p>
<p>Using three inverted wood shims about an inch wide, I suspend a grill about six inches below where the meat grill will go. On this grill I place a disposable rectangular aluminum cake pan wrapped with aluminum foil to catch meat drippings. Not using a drip pan is a major flaw in the original flower pot smoker concept IMO. If meat drippings fall onto the hot pie plate they impart a burned flavor to the meat and can extinguish the wood chunks as well as making the inside of the base flower pot nasty. </p>
<p>Next I place the grill and the meat to be smoked on the tops of the inverted wood shims. The wood shim method is a bit tricky until you get used to it, but I didn&rsquo;t want to drill the base flower pot to place bolts to support the grills as I though that might weaken the base flower pot.</p>

<p>The cherished terra cotta cover that is so hard to find is available from Patapsco Valley Sales (email: <a href="mailto:admin@patval.com">admin@patval.com</a>) ask for Jack or George Marshall @ 410-525-2325. The catalog number is 027-20 for a 20&rdquo; bowl which is what I used. My local garden shop ordered two for me. They are not cheap at $50 each, but they are a special order and shipping is expensive. The shape of the top is important for proper smoke circulation IMO. </p>
<p>I use a 2&rdquo; terra cotta saucer as a damper over the hole in the cover pot. ALAWYS allow a good flow of smoke through the smoker when using a gasket or the smoke will flash over and blow the cover off the smoker.  </p>
<p>In AB&rsquo;s book &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Just Here For the Food V2.0&rdquo; he states that he uses a 1000watt dimmer to control the hotplate temperature in his flower pot smoker. The 1000watt dimmer I use is available at: <a href="http://www.lightsonretail.com" target="_blank">http://www.lightsonretail.com</a> . The model # is: 1K-DIMMER. It is a Leviton 1K Dimmer. It cost $105 including shipping.</p>

The problem I have found is that you want a slow smolder for proper smoking. But with my 20&quot; bottom pot, when I set the dimmer high enough to get the cooking temp up to 220* the wood smoke billows out of the smoker. What you want is a thin line of smoke coming out of the smoker. So I have to smoke at 170-180 until I have applied enough smoke to the meat, then raise the temp to 220 to finish cooking. If you live in warm climate the Walgreen&#039;s 1000watt may be sufficient.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-6121" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wow! What an interesting project. I don&rsquo;t know how big your smoker will be, but the problem with the heat source will be this: when you smoke meat/poultry/fish you want a thin line of smoke. Just a smolder. If you turn the heat up on the hotplate high enough to get the heat up in the pot up to, say, 220 degrees, the smoke is going to billow out of the smoker. What I do is apply smoke to the meat/poultry/fish at 170 degrees, then finish the cooking at 220 degrees. Usually I only apply one pan&rsquo;s worth of smoke for poultry or fish, and as many as three for pork butts. In AB&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gear For Your Kitchen&rdquo; he lists the dimensions for the flower pot smoker as: a 16 &frac12; inch base (outside diameter at the top), with a 19 inch cover (outside diameter at the top). My pots are 20&rdquo; OD. Good luck and let&rsquo;s see some photos of the finished project!</p>

A couple of problems I have encountered  I have taken the burner off of the hot plate base to make for easier temp control. I bought the walgreens model but have had a real problem getting to 220 degrees. i have the control knob almost to high to get there! is this a normal thing? Second I noticed when I went to turn the temperature down after having it up for a while it would just turn off half way between med and low. Kind of like the on off portion of the knob was set at that area. any ideas there? Ive had fun making the smoker but also became somewhat frustrated with how many problems i would come across. putting the wires through the pot and trying to get them to reach the burner was an absolute pain! anyhow any help would be a huggggggggeeee help!!!

Used a small cast iron skillet for smoke pan and test burned it last night. Took hot plate totally apart from plastic housing and reassembled burner and unit in pot. Set burner on some 1&quot; brick pieces in pot and temp. control underneath pot set up on three normal height bricks as well. Turned burner on closed lid and in 15 min. unit was up to 400 deg with burner on medium set !!!!! To make long story short&#8230;temp is not a problem. To reach a set point of 225 deg, I wound up tuning burner on lowest point when light first comes on that shows burner is working, then placed soaked chunks in cast iron skillet on top of burner, then folded a piece of heavy foil placed it loosely over skillet with 2&quot; gaps on the four sides open for heat and smoke, then the grate. wound up leaving slid open about an inch to keep temp at 225. If i closed lid it would climb to 300 deg. cooked country style ribs for 3 hours used soaked wood to prevent flame ups that will crack pot quickly ( it happened) replaced wood chunks after 1.5 hours and cooked till meat was 180 deg..they turned out great. Just control flame ups and it was a snap..doing some chickens tomorrow</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-6366" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Brent,<br />
I&#039;m assembling mine this weekend&#8211;essentially identical to your configuration except my pot is a 16.5&quot; coupled with a 16&quot; drip terra cotta plate.  The plate seems to fit the pot perfectly.  I also purchased some hi-temp silicone to ensure a tight seal and protection from impact and eventual chipping/cracking where the top plate meets the pot.  (but after reading your writeup&#8230;I may not need it if the temps climb that high&#8230;) </p>
<p>Question: Given your 18.5&quot; pot and 16&quot; drip plate, does the plate rest &#039;inset&#039; in the inner lip of the pot?<br />
If so, did you drill and mount pull handles so you can easily lift the lid? </p>
<p>Also, given that I&#039;m using the same $9.99 Walgreens burner, was there enough slack in the wire on the temp. control when you mounted outside of the pot? (Just need to know if I&#039;ll need to get some extra wire before hand because I won&#039;t have access to hardware stores where I&#039;ll be when assembling&#8230;) </p>
<p>By the way, I also have a 14&quot; potter I had contemplated using for a dome cover&#8230;but it just seems like a lot of extra space and I worried about the temp. struggling to hear the larger area. It&#039;s just that I do like the idea of the &#039;headroom&#039; for the smoke to sort of rise up in fear that the drip plate scenario may impart a bitter smoke flavor because of the smaller area and stagnant/intense smoke inside the unit near the meat/fish when using the plate rather than than a bowl or upside down potter&#8211;your thoughts based on experience? </p>
<p>Thank you kindly&#8211;</p>

Found the pots at a local flower shop for around $40 and got the hot plate from WalGreens as suggested. I found the grill at Academy Sports as a replacement charcoal grill for $2. The only thing I did differently is that I cut the bottom of the pot to let the prongs from the hot plate stick through the bottom and placed a longer bolt through the hot plate than the original. Now the smoker sits on the base for the hot plate and the is no need for the feet I purchased. Wouldve saved about $8 if i had thought of this earlier.

<p>Grate &#8211; I got the Weber 7441 from HD.  I carried this thing around with me for a week looking for the pots.<br />
Pots &#8211; I found a 18 inch pots in a lot of places, but not with anything that could be used as a lid.  I finally got the pot and a &quot;patio pot&quot;, both 18&quot;, at Emerald Garden Nursery in Austin.  Total &#8211; $70<br />
Hot Plate &#8211; I got the square one at Walgreens for $10.  I took it completely apart, removed the LED from the circuit, and was able to move the controls to the outside of the pot.  The plate sits on two pieces of brick in the bottom of the pot.<br />
Pan &#8211; I used a heavy cake pan I had lying around.<br />
Thermometer &#8211; My grill thermometer was horrible innacurate and not adjustable, so I sprung for a Taylor Digital with external probe and timer for $17 at Amazon.  I will use this in other places.<br />
Wood &#8211; I got a bag of Apple chunks and a bag of Oak chunks at BBQ Galore for $5 each. </p>
<p>Use:  I did three meats in 24 hours.   </p>
<p>First, I did some pork ribs I had laying around.  I removed the membrane, rubbed them, and threw them on.  This was my test meat, and I was worried about temperature.  I should not have been.  With 4 chunks of wood, and the plate on low, I got smoke immediately, and had no trouble dialing in 220.  I waited about 3 hours, and checked the ribs for doneness (170).  I let them rest a bit &#8211; and they were incredible.  A little spicy, since I was over zealous with the rub, but even the wimpy teenager couldn&#39;t stop eating them. </p>
<p>Second, I did Alton&#39;s pulled pork for a party.  Brined overnight, started early, easy temp control, added wood every 2 hours or so, then finished it in a 350 oven so we could eat before we shot fireworks.  Rested it, pulled it, AWESOME.  My daughter said it was better than the Salt Lick!   </p>
<p>Third, I threw a store bought, pre-cooked Elgin sausage on the smoker for 45 minutes &#8211; and it was also awesome. </p>
<p>So, this thing was a hit.  Everyone was interested &#8211; the guys at the HD, the women at the nursery, and the dudes at BBQ Galore.  The family loved it.  Best $100 I have spent since my beer keg setup. </p>
<p>Next steps &#8211; $10 worth of fireplace gaskets for the seal. </p>
<p>Oh, and later that night, my lungs felt terrible.  It felt like I had smoked a pack of cigarettes.  I need to be more careful when I open the thing.  Also, sitting around, drinking beer, and watching the smoker for 8 hours can take a toll&#8230;.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-6614" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for a great website!  Got all my parts at HD.  Found a thick rim 16&quot; pot and a 15&quot; wide rim bowl (it is glazed on the outside).  I did this July 4th weekend and smoked a bone in 8# pork butt.  Soaked the wood chips in water overnight (1/2 Jack Daniels oak chips, 1/2 hickory),  filled the pan with dry wood chips with the wet chips on top to get a &quot;staged burn&quot;.  Held temp between 210 and 220 using an electronic thermometer with probe.  Opened her up after 15hrs and it was PERFECT!  I never replaced the wood, never opened the lid the whole time and it was still smoking. Wrapped in foil for an hour.  It literally fell off the bone and pulled apart&#8230;moist as could be.  Made the house smell like a BBQ joint.  I also bought self adhesive fireplace gasket online for $12 and will use this next time to seal the lid, instead of the kid&#039;s Playdooh that I used this time&#8230;.it works really well to seal those small gaps between the lid and pot.  It&#039;s also non-toxic.</p>

There&#039;s no &quot;lower&quot; setting I can try on the plate except &quot;off.&quot;  I even tried leaving the lid open an inch and a half or so, with no dice.

I smoked some ribs on it and my dad said they were the best he&#039;s ever had!  That means a lot because my dad is a rib connosuier!   </p>
<p>Unfortunately my burner went out in the middle of smoking some chicken the other day. I got the walgreen&#039;s special and even disassembled it so the controls were on the outside. Anyway, I&#039;m thinking of springing for the Leviton 1000w dimmer and was wondering, do I just disconnect the thermostat and original controls and connect the burner straight to the hot and neutral and then plug it into the dimmer?   in other words,  source &#8211;&gt; dimmer &#8211;&gt; hot and neutral &#8211;&gt; hot plate</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-6653" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#039;ve been thinking and planning about this for such a long time, and looking for the top bowl in the Boston area. Checked many Home Depots and several other stores but the biggest pot of that shape (&quot;azalea&quot; it&#039;s apparently called) is 12&quot;. Today at a Home Depot I finally found a decent one that fits nicely on top of a 16&quot; pot, but it&#039;s glazed/painted on the outside. It&#039;s not glazed on the inside, which makes me think it should be fine, but I can&#039;t be sure whether there is some other chemicals (lead?) or whatever in the material. The label on it says it&#039;s made in Malaysia, and apparently imported by New England Pottery. I&#039;ll ask them whether they know if this is pure clay, but in the meanwhile I took some pictures, to see what everybody thinks &#8212; help would be appreciated if anybody used something similar. If I can&#039;t find conclusive info on this, I&#039;ll just have to go return this, and then maybe buy a saucer and borrow a drill from someone for the hole.

I had the bottom pot from craigslist for free (it apparently came from Ikea), it&#039;s on the smaller side and my stupid Proctor-Silex hot plate didn&#039;t sit low enough. It took tons of tinkering because the temperature was rarely stable, but the results were still great.

<p>On another note, I am still trying to get my flowerpot smoker running again without having to send the hubs over to walgreen&#39;s to get me a new burner every month (as he is doing for me tonight, we want to smoke some meat tomorrow!). At some point when I can afford it, I want to get the Lutron dimmer and skip the crappy built-in t-stat alltogether, but for now it is new burners every so-often. One dilemma I am having is when I reconnect wires after re-wiring everything, what do I insulate them with? I got some high-heat electrical tape (only rated to 200 F though), and it melted, leaving the connection exposed, which then corroded, and no more smoky meat. Any suggestions?????</p>

<p>Wherever you are there should be an appliance repair shop around. You should be able to purchase some wire with high temperature insulation like what is used in an oven from them or find out where they purchase it from.

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-6758" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Im a big smoker fan, and a poor college student. when I found out about this a few weeks ago, I was really excited to get everything going and try it out. However, encountered a few problems. </p>
<p>Here in Gainesville Fl we have a lot of Lowes&#039;s and few other hardware/garden stores.Dont even bother at walmart. Lowes carries an 18 inch bottom pot that would work great and it fits the weber standard grill grids they sell there. However, it is only the bottom pot and its $30, the grate is 15, and there is no lid.  </p>
<p>Went to home depot WAY out of town, found a great (and huge) bottom pot for $24, a lid for 20 as well with a predrilled hole in it (and some legs sticking out from the top) rather than use a plate with no hole. Finding the terra cotta pots was a huge hassle, took 2 weeks, but I&#039;m glad i finally found them.  </p>
<p>Also, home depot and lowes carry the thermometer. Its in the grill section </p>
<p>The good news with my pots, I can fit the burner, smoke box, and TWO grids (the small 12 inch weber size) and the bigger 15.5 inch size in there, doubling my meat output per smoke. Bigger is better, so if you want to smoke for the week (or for a big family) it might be worth it to spend the extra $20-30 on the bigger pot and the extra grate. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, finding a hot plate is a pain in the butt. They dont sell the &quot;burner&quot; style anymore at any major store: walgreens, cvs, walmart, target, homedepot&#8230; IF i find one, it is a double burner that have the flat-style plate, which apparently isnt good for this project. I found this online for $13 plus shipping, along with some others that are in the $20 range. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Selectives-Single-Burner-2d/dp/B000HTM1QK/ref=pd_sbs_k_3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Selectives-Single-B&#8230;</a> but one reviewer complained about the ability to get the burner hot. I am still in the process of picking up the 15.5 inch grate online.  </p>
<p>Other than that, Ill check back in when i get the last parts together</p>

<p>Actually, I am still looking for a good heating element. That Walgreen&#039;s one was a bust. I found a small one at Ace hardware in Bellevue, WA that was a protor silex.   It is still square. the measurements  are 10&quot; x 11&quot;.  I was planning to take it apart to see if I can reduce the footprint and put the control outside.  It was only $16.99.<br />

<p>I was hoping to do it for Thanksgiving, but the storm messed up that plan. Let me know if you found something better. </p>
