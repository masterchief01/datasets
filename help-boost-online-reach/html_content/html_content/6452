<p>i had to purchase some kitchen scales to weigh my food and i was surprised at the weight of some foods. now i eat about 65grams of rice (weighed when uncooked) which is about 3-4 tablespoons and the portion seems like a lot of me. however before this i could easily be eating 250grams (uncooked) of rice. a lot of people carry around the notion that unless the meal is big then it wont fill you up. but really i think part of this probably stems from people eating more junk food which lacks fibre and has a high gi so will leave them feeling hungry quicker. not to mention eating healthily is sometimes mocked as "bird food", "bland"  etc. it would seem people get away with eating huge amounts of crap more than they do eating to live.</p><span class="qt"><a title="Reply" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="mtReplyCommentOnClick(56601, 'mia')">Reply</a></span></div><div class="commentreply"> <div class="c"><a name="comment-80352"></a><b>my belly growing fat</b> <p>3 to 4 spoons of rice? Are you really serious. Ithink weight hte rice is taking it to far.</p>

<p>The human body is designed to be able to eat a good amount of food.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to realize, it wasn't the amount of food that counts but the quality of the food.</p>

<p>Eat brown riche whole wheat foods and cut out all the processed junk, and you may be suprised at the amount of food you can eat, and still lose weight.</p><span class="qt"><a title="Reply" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="mtReplyCommentOnClick(80352, 'my belly growing fat')">Reply</a></span></div>

<p>quality is key... no doubt. But quantity? I think you are off.</p>

<p>Now I am saying this to make sure no one gets confused by what you wrote. Eat untill you are no longer hungry, NOT till you are full. </p>

<p>Even if you eat a "QUALITY" meal, stuffing yourself to the rim will not help the fat loss process.</p>

    <div class="commentreply"> <div class="c"><a name="comment-89703"></a><b>Customer Service</b> <p>I agree to what everyone is saying,  once your body is used to 300 calories per every 2.30 - 3hrs. you can pretty much eat what every you want as long as it's 40p/40c/20f - and the biggest selling point is you must work out 3 - 4 times per (resistance training) and implement Cardio 3 - 4 time per week or immdiatley after your workout.

You can't keep eating large portions and expect to look like that 'skinny' person.  Those portions are the size we are SUPPOSED to be eating.  You've trained yourself to not be satisfied with that amount.  You are the one who has to train yourself again.  Eat to live, not live to eat.

    </div> <div class="commentreply"> <div class="c"><a name="comment-106086"></a><b>Steve Kopp</b> <p>I joined the United States Marine Corps.. and working out while in the Delayed Entry Program I was able to keep a healthy track of how much I eat, and the Calories I intake, also the weight I was losing. I got a good work out, 3 times a day using a sauna suit, and sweats just walk for 10 minutes and then run for 3-5 minutes, and throw in some jumping jacks and mountain climbers for that personal sensation. I did this and lost 15 pounds in 1 week, but I also watched what I eat. This menu is extravagent, for people who need to visually see what is out there for them to eat and its appealing. I mean the food you actually cook doesnt look like that in the end. But It will be those foods, so In conclusion losing weight really depends on watching calories and working out. Enough said, just get your fat lazy asses off your computer and go out, buy a suana suit at your local wal-mart in the workout training equipment section, grab an old pair of sweats and tennis shoes, and go walk your ass a healthy dose of cardio. Dedication is the key. Dont forget to watch the calories too.</p><span class="qt"><a title="Reply" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="mtReplyCommentOnClick(106086, 'Steve Kopp')">Reply</a></span></div>

<p>Those are great as a reference for portions. I find it so hard to not eat everything in front of me when i go to the restaurant(usually take the other half home) Now I know I really shouldn't even be eating half of the plate as it's still an exagerated portion.</p>

<p>It's so much easier to eat at home.<br />

You will not loose much weight if you don't excercise.

    <div class="commentreply"> <div class="c"><a name="comment-97079"></a><b>Dr. Weight Loss</b> <p>One day, everyone will realize that everyones boday is different.  There are skinny people that eat 5-6 thousand calories a day and dont gain an ounce and dont work out, there are large people that eat healthy and excersize but lose weight very slowly.  Depending on your body one thing will work more effectively then another.  The best way is to eat right, excersize and don't expect the lbs to come of overnight, it takes time to lose weight.  Some people will respond to weight training, others to eating right, others to aerobic, the real trick is to find what your body responds to.  However, losing weight should be a goal, but being healthier is the more important part, so the men and woman that run 10 miles but eat junk food all day can still have negative effects.  </p>

Running on the treadmill or street or trails conditions your joints and muscles as it requires resitance of the muscles to off-set the pounding the joints take.  Basically, after your body adjusts after 4-6 weeks of walking, you must run.   Eat sensibly (ie. cut out salt, sugar and excessive fats) you will lose weight.  Elipitcals and stationary bikes, spinning, etc. is all crap exercise.  You MUST run.  Period. End of story.<br />

<p>If walking is not exercise, than neither is running.  Your post makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever.  Either way calories are burned, a calorie is just a measure of energy, and it takes energy to do anything.  So when energy is used, calories are burned.  It takes longer to burn calories when walking, but that does not invalidate walking as exercise.  The idea that walking isn't exercise is just nonsense.  It's just a low key exercise.  Also, your body adjusts to anything (including running) if you do the same thing consistently without increasing the difficulty and thus, continue to challenge yourself.  We all know that we need to eat sensibly, that's just common sense.  You MUST exercise, of which running is but one form, but it doesn't HAVE to be running.  Elipticals, spinning, etc... are all forms of exercise as well.  If you want to say "period/end of story" please make sense in the future, or expect for someone to tear a hole in your "logic".</p><span class="qt"><a title="Reply" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="mtReplyCommentOnClick(119378, 'Nicole')">Reply</a></span></div>

I've got a couple cookbooks like this, "300-Calorie One-Dish Meal Cookbook" and another that I can't remember the name of at the moment.  They're extremely helpful for making tasty meals -- my favorite is a roast beef sandwich in pita pocket with a tasty mix of sauces and spices and veggies.
