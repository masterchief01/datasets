<h3 class="title">The Best Way to Cook Bacon</h3>
<div class="posted">Categories: <a href="http://www.tonychor.com/archive/cat_food_and_drink.html">Food and Drink</a> <a href="http://www.tonychor.com/archive/cat_worlds_best.html">World's Best</a> </div>

<p><img alt="bacon.jpg" src="http://www.tonychor.com/archive/bacon.jpg" width="304" height="304" /></p>

<p>I love bacon. I mean I really love it. Good American bacon - the crunchy kind, not that flabby stuff you get in other countries. At the risk of offending entire religions and regions, I think much of the unrest in the world is because too many people don't know the joy of bacon. Almost no one who has tasted bacon would willingly blow themselves up or start shooting at someone else. Bacon is worth living for.</p>

<p>But, it can be a real challenge to cook bacon well. Frying it is a mess. Microwaving has inconsistent results. Plus, neither scales well to the large amounts of bacon needed for a big brunch (or just me on a Sunday morning.) The secret is to bake the bacon in the oven. </p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C or gasmark 7)</li>
<li>Take a large cookie sheet with a lip and cover it in aluminum foil. I like the wide heavy duty stuff that can cover the tray with a single piece.</li>
<li>Arrange the bacon on the sheet without overlapping.</li>
<li>Bake for six minutes.</li>
<li>Turn the cookie sheet around 180 degrees.</li>
<li>Bake for another 4-7 minutes depending on your oven and how crispy you like your bacon.</li>
<li>Lift the bacon out with tongs and set on a plate covered in paper towels. I dab the tops with another paper towel too.</li>
</ol>

<p>Result: piles of perfectly cooked bacon for your dining pleasure.</p>

<p>Here are the cool bits about this recipe: <ul><br />
<li>All of the bacon grease is in the pan on top of the foil. Once it cools down you can lift out the foil and throw it all away. No mess. Better still, you can spoon out the fat to scramble eggs in (because what goes better with hot bacon than eggs scrambled in bacon fat?) Beet greens or spinach stir fried in bacon fat with crumbled bacon on top is delicious too.</li><br />
<li>The turning around part is the magic move. Most ovens don't heat evenly. By turning the tray around, you ensure all the bacon cooks evenly. It's really amazing to me how evident the heat variation is when you see the bacon.</li><br />
<li>If you want more bacon (and who doesn't), stick more cookie sheets in the oven at the same time. You can do tons at once this way with no additional time and minimal additional effort.</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>I've read a variation of this recipe that recommends putting a wire rack in the cookie sheet to keep the bacon out of the fat. I tried it. The results aren't any better, the bacon sticks to the rack, and the rack is a mess to clean up. Stick to the simple solution above.</p>

<p>While I'm at it, I'll put in a plug for <a href="http://www.nimanranch.com/p/391200-91/c/Pork-SmokedAndCured">Niman Ranch bacon</a>. This is the real deal. Thick cut, smoky, and meaty, this stuff is made from happy, pesticide-free, free range pigs that lead productive, satisfying lives and died in the prime of their tastiness for you and me. Oh man, this stuff is good as is everything from Niman Ranch. Go get some today (Trader Joe's carries the stuff as do other good stores.)</p>

<p>Mmm, salty, rich, crunchy, and meaty. What's not to love?</p>

<p>I agree-- the oven is the way to go. And if you sprinkle brown sugar on the bacon before baking you get a lovely caramelized sugary coating. A sweet (and sticky) counterpoint to the salty crunch. Yum.</p>

<p>While I'll give you points on the oven, this burnt to a crisp bacon thing has to stop.  Really.  It's truly savage.  You don't cook any other meat to a crisp right?  Why?  It tastes better.  Exactly.  We've moved past the caveman, smouldering, charred piece of meat cooking techniques.  Come forward with us.  For the love of God.</p>

<p>Chooky,your people over-cook every other piece of meat, so where's the moral high-ground? Besides, I'm not sure we should take food advice from a people who's culinary highlights include runny eggs with jam, black (blood) pudding, and canned baked beans for breakfast.</p>

<p>Hey Tony;</p>

<p>This message is strictly a personal one, posted on your website.  It's Irene and Alberta.  We are both living in the Chicago area now (in fact, I'm at Berta's, and we googled you, and there you are), and since 20 years have passed, we decided to find out how you're doing.  If you want to catch up, you can email us at Irene's email...reading some of your stuff, it makes us remember what we all had in common, and what a good time we had.</p>

<p>OMG Tony, this is awesome.  I have a bacon press I use to try and keep the wiggly little slivers of pork goodness flat and crispy and minimze the fatty oil filled pockets...  but I can only cook five strips of bacon at a time. Unacceptable!  </p>

<p>Next weekend, I'm making bacon in the oven.  I'm a little worried about the grease removal process to a frying pan, but we'll see how it goes.  Usually I fry eggs 'basted' style in the leftover bacon grease.  The yellows stay nicely soft for toast dipping, the whites are cooked and not slimy on top, and there is no risk of yolk breakage from clumsy flipping.  Large and relatively quick quantities of perfect bacon is worth the risk though - I'll just make sure the egg poaching pan is ready to go in case I need a plan B for the chicken's contribution to breakfast.</p>

<p>mmmmmm.  everythings better with bacon...  but you've got to lay off the folks who eat baked beans with their breakfast.  With all the culinary train wrecks to make fun of in the UK (spotted dick? brown sauce? the baked beans actually aren't that bad. (yeah, it's one of the better British habits I've imported along with PG Tips and HobNobs). </p>

<p>Help me with this, please.  I like your hint about baking in the over; however, I'll be cooking for a rather large group. I will need to bake the bacon at my home the night before and the next morning carry the bacon to the breakfast meeting.  (There is no cooking equipment there)<br />
We do however have a microwave available.  How do I re-heat the bacon after I've baked it the night before?</p>

<p>Sorry, Marcia, I don't have any experience at re-heating bacon; I mean, who has bacon left-over that they need to reheat? :)</p>

<p>All I can suggest is trying it at home first. Bake a sheet of bacon, let it cool, and then try reheating it in the microwave. I suspect it'll be fine.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

i learned the technique while serving brunch on sundays at a five star hotel, do you really think that they are cooking 500 pieces of bacon on the stove top. of course not, the only way is in sheet pans and the oven!! glad to see this info is being passed out of the restaurant kitchens and to the home  Bacon for all! now you can cook 100 slices of bacon at the same time in just a few minutes!!!</p>

<p>Bacon should be cooked until the rind has 'crisped' a little - no more than that.</p>

<p>Soggy rind is disgusting, so is crispy bacon meat.</p>

<p>Cook it in a frying pan with no fat added - and most importantly, buy good quality bacon that hasn't been injected with water to bulk it up, otherwise it ends up 'steaming' itself. </p>

<p>Anyone tried 'turkey bacon' - its not as tasty, but its a far healthier option.</p>

<p>You guys are too funny!!  I had a friend in college who told me the story of how when he was a child, his grandmom cooked up a pound of bacon and he ate it all himself.  Got so sick he could not even take a peek at bacon again until I persuaded him to try this method.  Friend is now all fixed and loves bacon once more.  Moral of story: never eat 1 pound at 1 sitting.  Spread the love out and leave the pigging to the pigs....Awesome cooking method!  Thanks Tony!</p>

<p>Enjoy!<br />
Ruth</p>

<p>Bacon and Shell Macaroni Supper</p>

<p>8 slices thick bacon, cut up about 1" pieces<br />
½ small onion, diced<br />
1 ½ c small shell macaroni, cooked and drained<br />
1 small can (8 oz) tomato sauce<br />
Pepper to taste</p>

<p>All amounts of ingredients can be adjusted to taste.</p>

<p>Boil shell macaroni. Fry bacon, remove and set aside.  Drain most of the bacon grease from pan and fry onions till clear. Add pepper.  When Onions are done, add the bacon back and the macaroni to pan.  Add tomato sauce, stir to coat.</p>

<p>The amount of pepper is to taste.  It can get spicy hot real fast and I like it that way so mine is usually a little hot. This is usually  put in a casserole and baked for about a half hour, but I eat it straight from the pan.  The amounts above will feed 2 people with a  little left over.  I usually have the left overs for breakfast the next morning.  The amounts above are not critical.  If you are feeding  more, use more bacon and macaroni.  Only use the small shell macaroni  as it holds the tomato sauce the best.  Also, if you like more bacon,  then use more bacon.  If  you like it more moist, use two cans of  tomato sauce.  If you increase the recipe or plan on baking it, then use two cans of tomato sauce.</p>

<p>My mom used to make this and as best as I can remember, this has the correct ingredients.  Mom would use a whole pound of bacon, a whole small bag of shell macaroni and two cans of tomato sauce and this fed all 6 of us.  She also baked it and it was crispy on the edges.</p>

<p>Please answer this as soon as possible.  I need to cook a lot of bacon for a breakfast party, and I have never cooked it in the oven.  Do you have to cover the bacon with foil when cooking it in the oven?  Does grease splatter all over the oven if it is not covered?  Thanks for a quick response.</p>

<p>Oh, what a shame to put bacon in the oven. :-P<br />

<p>Actually, bacon cooked in the oven does cook in its own fat. It doesn't get dry which is great, because I agree that fat=flavor!!</p>

<p>An even better way to cook bacon is to put it on a cooling rack and then put the cooling rack on a roasting pan and into the oven at 375 C for 15-20 min, depending on how thick your bacon is . It gets perfectly crispy on both sides and a lot of the fat drains away so it isn't as greasy.</p>

<p>Thanks, Zoey, for the tip. As I mentioned in the post, I tried cooking the bacon on the rack, but I found it to be messy (hard to clean the rack) and didn't provide better results. The bacon in the method I describe does get crispy and isn't greasy (well, any more greasy than bacon should be... yum.)</p>

<p>My variation on this is to take prunes (dried plums) and wrap them in a half-strip of bacon, arrange them on a grill pan that has drip slots into a cooking pan, at (and this tends to vary, because I forget in between times) 425 degrees for 15 or 20 minutes. Because the bacon is wrapped on itself, it takes a little longer than laid out as strips, but mmmm, it's good! I've seen someone do the same but inject blue cheese into the prunes (excellent, but time-consuming). You could actually do this with other things, too -- I've had shrimp this way, on a grill, and it was excellent; I want to try garlic cloves -- but as far as dried fruit goes, prunes seem to retain more of their water so they don't get as dry as fast as, say, dried apricots (tho I've used those, too).</p>

<p>Great idea.  However a bit of personal experience/warning.  Due to the heat/humidity here this AM I tried this on a nat. gas outdoor grill.  I was monitoring the temp and time--all was going quite well through the first turn.  However after that the bacon cooked VERY fast and sadly I was left with little black sticks. . I need to test, but my hunch is (if using outdoor grill) go only 1 minute after turn and then prop cover and watch the rest of the way. I'll try again another day and report on success rate.  ~~Baconless Bill<br />

<p>Oh yeah baby, this recipe is perfection in simplicity.  Bacon was always impossible to get right, but with these tips it comes out perfect every time.  Thick cut or regular cut, it works great!  I like to grind black pepper on mine before baking.  Also, the bacon won't likely be crispy during baking - the crucial part is when it is drying off on some paper towels.  Thanks again!</p>

<p>Thanks so much!  This came out great.  I had heard about cooking bacon in the oven, so I googled and found this.  The only problem we had is that our smoke/heat detector KEPT going off.  It will usually go off any time the oven is set at 400 degrees or higher, but usually only when you open the door.  I cooked a little over half pound, saw how good it came out, so decided to cook the rest.  That's what led to the problem with the smoke detector (hot cookie sheet sitting on stove top).  It was driving my husband crazy, but then again, he's not a big bacon eater, so who cares, LOL.  Thanks again!</p>

<p>I've bookmarked this page, and I look forward to trying this method.  (I got here by Googling "cooking large quantities of bacon.")  Bacon is sooooo messy to handle, including in trying repackage it after using say just 4 strips for breakfast.  I'm paranoid about preventing bacterial contamination from raw bacon on my hands, etc.  So I's rather just cook the whole package at once.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced bacon is "bad for you."  (The book "Good Calories, Bad Calories" by Gary Taubes, while not firmly conclusive, is worth a read re persistence of "fat is bad," "cholesterol is bad" etc. memes.)</p>

<p>thanks, tony!<br />
a girl friend of mine made bacon in the oven and it was absolutely perfect.  i knew someone else loved bacon as much as we do and would post the best method for me, bwa haha!</p>

<p>i have to say that it's important to keep the bacon immersed in its own fat for even cooking.  at my mum's house (serving brekkie to a crowd of course) and the things that are passing for cookie sheets these days do not have the sort of lip needed to dam the volume of bacon fat required here.  (at least, the ones my mum buys don't.)  i had to use the bottom of the broiler pan, which kind of comes up in the corners.  the ends of the bacon slices in those corners were overdone, but everything else was perfect.  i could have solved it by moving things mid-way; learn something new every day.</p>

<p>this is the only workable method to make bacon when serving, say, BLTs.  or brunch.  how else can you get everything to come out at the same time?  and it's just such superior even cooking in general, i'm going to costco for more bacon and it will be bacon-palooza around here.  after the BLTs and bacon-festooned salads, we'll go on to bacon-laced potato salad, bacon cheeseburgers, and these little appetizers that the pioneer woman makes with club crackers (also in the oven) - if you haven't tried them, you simply must.</p>

<p>If you're single and have a microwave, you can use this method to cook a bunch of bacon up front and then store it in the fridge until you're ready to eat some more.</p>

<p>After the bacon has initially cooled, place the bacon in freezer bags, wrapped in paper towel, and then place it in your fridge.</p>

<p>When you're ready to have some more bacon, nuke the desired amount of bacon in 10-15 second increments until it reaches the correct temperature.</p>

<p>Ball up the Aluminum Foil then unfold it before putting it in the pan.  Then arrange the Bacon on top of the foil.  It gives the bacon fat places to go instead of having the bacon resting in the grease.  Another idea is to put one layer on the pan then put wire racks in the pan then put more foil over the wire racks. Poke a bunch of holes in the top layer of foil, then arrange your bacon atop the foil covered racks then bake for 15-20 minutes. Perfet Bacon Everytime because the grease drops thru the holes an onto the bottom layer of foil.  Zero Cleanup since the Pan and Rack were protected by foil. </p>

<p>Question:  Since everyone is concerned with the environment and not wasting natural products (like aluminum)  could parchment paper be used rather than foil?  I would really appreciate an answer at my E-Mail address.  Yes:  stove-top cooked bacon can be splattery-messy, so  the oven baked would help that. Also, I was interested to read that the oven-baking does not splatter. YES!!!</p>

<p>I just made this in the oven. SO EASY. I had frozen bacon in the freezer. Unthawed it in the microwave, layered it over two cookie sheets with foil covered... sprinkled half with pepper, half with brown sugar... so tasty!</p>

<p>I noticed the brown sugar one burned a bit easier, so you may wanna watch that. The turning 180 degrees is the perfect touch. I baked two pans, with the big one on bottom, a little dollar tree one on the rack right above, and while the bottom was a little less crunchy (I prefer mine chewy, my boyfriend prefers his crunchy), it was all done perfectly. Clean up was SO SIMPLE.</p>

<p>Seriously, being able to just crumple up the foil, let the pans cool, and pop them back into the drawer was pretty amazing, considering how messy bacon usually is. It didn't splatter my oven, though it was a tiny bit smoky (ran the fan and it was fine).</p>

<p>Amazing! Never going back to pan cooking. =)</p>

<p>Hey.......  as Chef Emeril Lagasse says "pork fat rules"!! Loved the many different comments. I like the basic instructions, tho I did add a little brown sugar and very little pepper. Gave it a salty, sweet,lightly peppery background... Yummooooooooooooo!!!</p>

<p>Why are people arguing about bacon on here?  Crispy or not.<br />
It all tastes the same, its about texture.  Some people like a soggy warm feelings in their mouth, while others like it thick and crispy.  I dont even mind it burnt.<br />
I prefer the latter myself, being a Canadian (and I am not a fan of back bacon).<br />
Brown Sugar is a great addition. One thing I like to do is wrap water chestnuts in bacon with brown sugar sprinkled on them, held together by a tooth pick and baked til crispy.  Delicious.<br />
Try Red Dot thick cut bacon if you ever get the chance, or even bacon chocolate is a tasty surprise.</p>

<p>I love this recipe!! Until I found this, I had pretty much refused to cook bacon for more than two people because it is such a pain! Now I can cook the whole package (or two) and not have to worry about burning myself or the bacon. It's really wonderful! I also really enjoy it with the brown sugar on top, although since it can burn easily, I wait until I turn the bacon to add it. It always end up being perfect that way!</p>

<p>My dad used to sprinkle a little sugar on the bacon when cooking and made such an incredible difference in flavor. I recently discovered another tasty way to do bacon. Before turning it in the oven, mix a little cayenne pepper with some warmed maple syrup and slather on the bacon. Mmmmmm, a little spicy sweet with the salty and fatty goodness of the bacon. </p>

<p>I just did this, complete with eggs scrambled in the grease with onions and cheese. It worked so perfectly that I didn't need any sort of seasoning whatsoever. Thanks a bunch, will use this often. And you're right on about Niman Ranch, they're the best. </p>

<p>I recently cooked about 4 lbs in the oven for a crowd (it was a thicker variety of bacon). It was not crispy at all.  Limp and greasy. Cooked it a little longer and all it got was dark not crisp. I used parchment paper-don't know if that's the reason or not. Have not tried this method yet (of turning the pan) and perhaps I didn't put it on the paper towels fast enough. I had to cook it ahead of time and then it was reheated. For this large a batch should I reheat in the oven, if so at what temp and how long?  I hate limp bacon. Any ideas why mine wouldn't get crisp?</p>

<p>to Max </p>

<p>leave the bacon in longer. 350 degrees in a  circulated oven is more than hot enough, and anywhere from 15-25 minutes. Flip the bacon anywhere after the first 7-10 minutes, depending how fast it is cooking. </p>

<p>lol, rack is "better" for crisp flavour. Granted if you prefer the greasy mush, then fry it in a pan.</p>

<p>It can take twice as long to cook it on a rack, and you don't need to preheat. As with most meats, such as steak, or pork roast, when it's cooked in an oven the meat becomes more flavourful, and has that "fall off the bone quality". Bacon is no exception, though its texture will be different than that of a pork roast, but i gurantee you that cooking it properly on a rack is better for texture, and flavour than frying, regardless if it's being fried in an oven or in a pan.</p>

<p>Sorry, it's not the meat being cooked in an oven is makes it better, it's being that the meat is slowly cooked compared to cooking it 4-5 mins in a pan, or in an oven.</p>

<p>Typicaly cooking bacon on the rack takes around 40 mins.</p>

<p>OMG.... fried bacon all my life with mixed results.  This is sooo simple and good.  Just finished baking a pound.... 4 people had bacon sandwiches as a snack.... plenty of artery clogging bacon grease for a recipe of potato salad (yes with bacon grease) and fried bananas with chocolate syrup for desert (yes, fried with bacon grease).... mmmmm...... glad to be from the south where bacon grease RULES.</p>

<p>BACON USED TO CRISP UP AND MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. NOW, IT GETS TOUGH AND SORT OF HARD TO CHEW. IS IT BECAUSE THEY ARE BREEDING THE HOGS TO BE LEANER. EGGS COOKED IN BACON GREASE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO GO!!</p>
