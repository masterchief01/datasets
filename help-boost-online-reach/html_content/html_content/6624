<p>There is still much that remains a mystery about the disease fibromyalgia.   The exact cause of the condition continues to elude researchers, although they  have begun to develop several theories about what triggers the disease. Possible  culprits include stress, injury or physical trauma, emotional trauma, lyme  disease and a weakened immune system. Here is a closer look at each of these  factors and their possible role in the development of <a title="Understanding Fibromyalgia" href="/fibromyalgia-definition/fibromyalgia-about.html">fibromyalgia</a>.</p>
<h2>Stress</h2>
<p>Stress is a normal part of everyday life.  Ordinary levels of stress  typically do not present a problem for most people.  Our reactions to stress are  measured by our ability to handle each stressful event. Thus, &#8220;normal&#8221; stress  for one person might be quite overwhelming for another.</p>
<p>Stress can develop for a number of reasons.  A traumatic accident, death, or  emergency may cause stress. Stress can occur as a side effect of a serious  illness or disease. Daily life and work responsibilities, and family pressures  can also cause stress to develop.</p>
<p>High stress lifestyles are common in the United States. The American culture  is a high-paced world of technology and instant access to information.  These  patterns of stress can quickly lead to burn out, where the individual can no  longer function. This condition of chronic burn out is universal in people who  develop fibromyalgia. For more help with stress please visit <a href="http://www.stress-anxiety-depression.org/">The Stress &amp; Anxiety  Resource Center</a>.</p>
<h2>Injury or Physical Trauma</h2>
<p>Most individuals who suffer from fibromyalgia have a previous history of  injury or physical trauma. Falls, motor vehicle accidents, prolonged labor  during childbirth, loss of blood, head traumas, spinal injuries, bone fractures,  surgeries, internal injuries, major dental work, sports injuries, and surgical  operations are some examples of injuries and physical trauma that could lead to  <a title="Fibromyalgia Symptoms" href="../fibromyalgia-causes-symptoms-signs/fibromyalgia-symptoms.html">fibromyalgia  symptoms</a>.</p>
<p>The site of injury or trauma is also significant in the development of  fibromyalgia.  The abdominal area is of particular concern, as most fibromyalgia  patients have experienced some type of abdominal injury or trauma (pregnancy,  childbirth, and cesarean section surgery are all considered abdominal trauma).  Cervical and lumbar whiplash injuries, which may or may not involve disk  problems and coccyx injuries, are also common in fibromyalgia clients. Some of  these injuries or traumas may have occurred years before the onset of  fibromyalgia. Researchers believe that these injuries or traumas may somehow  affect the central nervous system and be one of the causes of fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>Fibromyalgia may be associated with changes in muscle metabolism, such as  decreased blood flow to the muscles that causes fatigue and decreased strength.  These changes in muscle metabolism may occur as the result of a past muscle  injury.</p>
<h2>Emotional Trauma</h2>
<p>Emotional trauma can be just as devastating to the body as physical trauma.  Chronic worry, anxiety, fear, anger, sadness, and grief are especially damaging  to the body’s energy levels and immune system defenses. Most people have  experienced some type of emotional trauma in their lives, either through the  loss of loved ones or the ending of relationships. However, these traumas may  have been particularly severe for patients who suffer from fibromyalgia.  It is  common for fibromyalgia sufferers to have experienced physical, sexual, or  emotional abuse in the past. Many fibromyalgia patients have suffered a series  of traumatic events.  As with physical traumas, these traumas may have occurred  years before the onset of fibromyalgia.</p>
<h2>Weakened Immune System</h2>
<p>Several factors can cause the immune system to become weak.  Emotional  factors include prolonged stress, depression, and anxiety.  Physical factors  such as poor nutrition, sleep deprivation, illness, allergies, and medications  can reduce the effectiveness of the body&#8217;s immunity. Symptoms of a weakened  immune system include fatigue, susceptibility to illness (especially colds and  flues), low stress tolerance, recurrent infections, easy bruising, and slow  wound healing.  Over time, a weakened immune system can also cause fibromyalgia  to develop. In these cases, patients often feel their fibromyalgia start with a  cold or flu that just never seems to go away. A toxic and compacted colon can  also lead to a weak immune system. I recommend a regular <a title="Colon Cleanse with Oxy-Powder" href="http://www.oxypowder.com/">colon  cleanse</a> or <a title="Dr. Group's Liver &amp; Gallbladder Cleanse" href="http://www.ghchealth.com/liver-and-gallbladder-flush.html">Liver  Cleanse</a> to help with an optimal immune system.</p>
<h2>Lyme Disease</h2>
<p>A recent study suggests that over 75% of the patients diagnosed with  Fibromyalgia also have Lyme Disease. Lyme Disease, sometimes misspelled ‘Lime  Disease’, is so-named because it was first identified in the United States Lyme,  Connecticut, in 1975. However, the history of Lyme Disease precedes its first  United States diagnosis. In Europe a skin rash with striking similarities had  been described in medical literature around the turn of the century, and it has  been suggested that Lyme Disease may have spread to the United States from  Europe in the early 1900’s. The cause of Lyme Disease is a type of bacteria  called a spirochete (pronounced “spi-ro-keet”). Its appearance under a powerful  microscope is that of a cork-screw. The Lyme Disease spirochete is most often  passed to humans by ticks (deer ticks, wood ticks, or black-legged ticks).  Therefore it is most common in wooded, suburban areas. Lyme Disease symptoms can  often be misleading and difficult to diagnose. Early symptoms starting within a  few days of infection is often a rash, starting with a red dot at the point of  infection and radiating out. The center may then fade, creating a circular  “bulls-eye” pattern. Other symptoms may include fevers, chills, stiff joints,  muscle ache, and fatigue. Because many symptoms may emulate other illnesses Lyme  disease has often been called the ‘Great Imitator’.</p>
<h2>Preventing Fibromyalgia</h2>
<p>There is little that can be done to prevent the injuries and traumas that  will occur throughout our lives.  So the best way to prevent fibromyalgia in  those who consider themselves susceptible is to minimize stress, and restore the  strength of the immune system.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Minimizing Stress</em>: Stress management techniques such as meditation,  yoga, tai chi, and deep breathing exercises are excellent ways to reduce stress  in the body and mind and help alleviate the <a href="../fibromyalgia-causes-symptoms-signs/understanding-fibromyalgia-symptoms.html">symptoms  of fibromyalgia</a>. Exercise is another great stress-reducer that also helps to  improve the overall health of the body.</li>
<li><em>Strengthen The Immune System</em>: A healthy diet and regular exercise  are the keys to a strong immune system.  A healthy diet will provide the body  with the nutrients it needs to maintain and repair cells.  Exercise helps to  move these nutrients, as well as water and waste, throughout the system.   Exercise also helps to improve the circulation and improve mobility in the  joints.</li>
</ul>
