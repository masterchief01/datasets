<h1>FDA Suddenly Bans Drugs That Have Been On The Market For Decades</h1><h3>from the <i>perfect-gin-and-tonic-for-fun-and-profit</i> dept</h3><p>As Techdirt recently discussed, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110308/03234513398/drug-firms-freaking-out-over-expiring-patents.shtml">the drug pipeline is running
dry</a>, as Big Pharma's patents are beginning to expire, and the drug companies are freaking out. For years they have been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2011/03/07/business/07drug-gfx.html?ref=business" target="_blank">spending more money on research and testing and getting fewer results</a>. This year alone they are
going to have 11 patents expire on drugs that bring in approximately $50 billion in revenue to the big pharma firms.  Of course, the flip side to this is that consumers can start saving about 95% on the price of those drugs, as generics hit the market. The
drug companies have gotten to a point where the incremental increases in
efficiencies are so small as to be meaningless. What is coming is <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060920/011435.shtml">more personalized and targeted treatments</a> for diseases -- treatments that do not
require bulk production of a specific chemical, but individual testing and
personalized care, and not lifetime treatments and repeat sales, but cures. The treatments will be expensive to begin with, but they will become less expensive over
time. The business model of healthcare is about to
change dramatically, and Big Pharma needs to do something to maintain their profits.
Unfortunately, they seem to have chosen the path of regulating the competition
out of existence, rather than competing and innovating.
<br /><br />
One way the drug companies have been coping is to repackage and rebrand
health food supplements. Drugs like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovaza" target="_blank">Lovaza</a>, which is nothing
more than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_oil" target="_blank">fish oil</a> you can get in health food stores, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovastatin" target="_blank">lovastatin</a> which has been in use for roughly a thousand years
(800 AD) in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_yeast_rice" target="_blank">red yeast rice</a>. In the case of
lovastatin, the FDA <a href="http://forums.kffl.com/threads/278529-Drug-companies-vs-supplement-industry" target="_blank">banned the supplements</a> because they are "identical to a drug
and, thus, subject to regulation as a drug." That is very convenient
for the drug company, which now charges monopoly rents on the product -- which can <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110311/01545013458/retroactive-drug-monopoly-raises-rates-10-to-1500.shtml">increase prices</a> at ridiculous levels.
<br /><br />
More recently, the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/SelectedEnforcementActionsonUnapprovedDrugs/ucm245106.htm" target="_blank">FDA banned 500 prescription drugs</a> that had been on the market and working for years. To be fair, it was really <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/SelectedEnforcementActionsonUnapprovedDrugs/ucm119899.pdf" target="_blank">50-100 drugs</a> (pdf), made by different companies, but that just highlights how there was actual competition in the marketplace for these drugs, which has now been removed.  For
all of the drugs, there is either a high-priced prescription version, or all
the small manufacturers have been removed, leaving a virtual monopoly for one
or more larger companies. This process began in <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070290.pdf">2006 when the
FDA decided to remove marketed unapproved drugs</a> (pdf).
<br /><br />
The reasoning is that these drugs weren't ever technically "approved" by the FDA.  While the FDA has been around for about a century, the business of having the FDA first approve drugs before they could go on the market came about closer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetics_Act_Amendments" target="_blank">fifty years ago</a>, and a bunch of "unapproved drugs" that were in common usage before that never got approved.  The FDA is targeting many of those, even if they have a long history in the marketplace.  Conveniently, of course, there always seems to be a pharma company with a monopolized substitute ready.
<br /><br />
In 2006 the first "new" monopoly that was created by this FDA process was for the
malaria drug <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine" target="_blank">quinine sulfate</a>. This left
only <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/SelectedEnforcementActionsonUnapprovedDrugs/ucm119653.pdf" target="_blank">Mutual Pharmaceutical Company to manufacture quinine in the
US</a> (pdf). While malaria is not a disease that affects many people in the US, it
is big business worldwide. Malaria causes <a href="http://malaria.jhsph.edu/about_malaria/" target="_blank">300 to 500 million
infections and over 1 million deaths</a> each year. Treating this disease with
quinine used to cost pennies a day.   In fact, the British turned this
treatment into a cocktail, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_and_tonic" target="_blank">the gin and tonic (quinine water)</a>.
<br /><br />
Another drug removed was the antihistamine <a href="http://www.carbinoxamine.com/" target="_blank">carbinoxamine</a>,
which was created prior to needing FDA approval, in the early 1950s. It was
approved by the FDA in a slightly modified form in 2006. It is
now sold exclusively by Mikart, Inc and Pamlab, LLC with no future competition
because the FDA has <a href="http://www.carbinoxamine.com/fda.php" target="_blank">banned all 120 other
versions</a> of carbinoxamine.  You can imagine just how much that must increase the profits for Mikart and Pamlab on carbinoxamine, though that seems to come at the expense of consumers.
<br /><br />
It's
really nice being granted a government monopoly. 
<br /><br />
As for the drugs now being banned in this latest purge, you can argue that it's not really 500
drugs, because many are different combinations of the same 50 to 100 drugs.
To be sold, these disapproved drugs will require drug trials and
certification -- a massive and expensive process. Under current law, after
successful completion of FDA trials these drugs will be granted approval. But
in every case these trials are almost certainly not necessary.  And, "coincidentally" in almost every case, there is a chemically similar
patented version ready to go. This is a pure money grab: replacing old
tried and true drugs, with monopoly priced prescription drugs. It just
requires removing competing drugs from the market to increase profits.
<br /><br />
And with that, I'm off to go have a gin and tonic, while it's still legal...</p>

It's  pretty  bad  when  these  corporations  have  infiltrated  every  office  of  government,  from  SCOTUS  (which  granted  patent  rights  on  nature),  to  the  Dept  of  Justice  (Hello,  Neo  RIAA),  to  offices  like  the  FDA,  now  in  the  business  of  killing  people  rather  than  saving  them.<br />

I  still  have  faith  people  will  eventually  wake  up  and  make  changes  to  government  to  fix  it,  but  every  year,  and  with  every  new  law  passed/introduced,  such  as  the  HCRA  and  COICA,  I  lose  a  piece  that  faith,  especially  when  those  very  politicians  use  the  very  words  as  given  to  them  by  those  who  supplied  their  campaign  contributions  with  more  money  than  most  of  us  will  earn  in  our  lifetime.<br />

If  I  link  you  too  1500  articles  which  all  claim  to  fix  the  same  problem,  would  you  have  the  time(or  know  how)  to  decide  what  is  best  for  you?

Hell,  even  now  we  have  scumbags  who  sell  bracelets  with  a  refrigerator  magnet  claiming  they  improve  balance,  health,  etc.  and  people  buy  them  up  thinking  they  work.

It's  safe,  it  works(as  a  placebo),  and  ultimately  nobody  would  know  differently.<br />

In  your  wild  west  we  would  degrade  to  selling  products  which  are  entirely  safe,  and  could  be  marketed  the  best,  not  which  compounds  are  shown  to  be  safe  and  shown  to  work  through  scientific  study.

As  for  efficacy,  perhaps  you  should  read  up  on  the  pharmaceutical  industry.    Most  drugs  have  inconsistent  results  and  only  a  very  small  number  of  drugs  could  pass  a  test  which  compared  their  outcome  to  that  of  a  placebo.<br />

The  solution  is  multi  fold.  Allow  any  drugs  that  are  no  longer  patented  to  become  generic.  Prevent  the  FDA  from  removing  generic  drugs  from  the  market  unless  they  possess  some  health  risk.

<div class="cbody">So  your  solution  is  to  privatize  it  and  hope  that  private  companies  won't  fall  into  the  same  mold  as  you  believe  the  FDA  is  in(I'm  not  really  sure  that  it's  filled  with  all  the  evilness  that  some  on  this  site  think).    Really,  we're  trading  one  thing  for  the  other.<br />
<br />
Snake  oil  actually  has  some  use,  but  I  don't  believe  it's  for  anything  that  it  was  actually  marketed  to  cure.    All  I  ask  is  that  if  you're  making  claims  that  what  you  sell(drug  or  "supplement")  is  somewhat  verified  by  a  3rd  party  and  it  won't  harm(or  at  least  the  harms  are  fully  disclosed  so  those  prescribing  the  medicines  can  use  their  best  judgment).<br />
<br />
To  me,  the  story  isn't  taking  these  drugs  off  the  market,  it  was  originally  allowing  these  supplements  on  the  market.    Let's  give  a  hypo  to  show  why  I  thought  it  was  a  problem:  Supplement  x  contains  aspirin,  consumer  buys  it  to  cure  his  headache,  since  there  is  no  concentration  on  the  package(or  instructions  on  how  to  take  it)  consumer  takes  too  much  an  overdoses.    The  other  problem  is  that  with  any  supplement,  the  active  ingredient  is  variable,  so  it's  tough  to  actually  use  it  to  treat  with  the  specificity  that  you  want.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=242#addyourcomment" cid="242" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: And!" cid="242" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_242" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c242">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c242">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

My  concerns  are  that  concentrations  can  very,  and  interactions  could  dramatically  change  from  dose  to  dose.    I  also  think  that  a  secondary  effect  is  that  it  will  bring  to  light  that  these  things  are  actually  drugs,  so  people  will  disclose  them  to  doctors  when  they  are  ill,  so  Drs  can  make  sure  that  other  drugs  won't  interact  with  the  supplement.<br />

<div class="cbody">I  read  about  a  discovery  in  2007  where  70-something  percent  of  cancer  in  rats  was  cured  by  a  simple  drug  we  didn't  know  had  an  effect  on  cancer  until  some  scientist/doctor  happened  to  test  it.    I  was  excited  because  I  knew  with  something  that  big,  it  would  be  brought  to  patients  as  fast  as  possible.<br />
<br />
Well,  I  stumbled  upon  it  again  while  debunking  and  fact-checking  all  the  stupid  "cures"  and  old  wive's  tales  on  cancer....in  2010!    They  literally  had  JUST  started  getting  enough  support  to  pay  for  the  stupidly  expensive  and  unnecessary  trials  3  years  later!    The  reason?  <br /> 
<br />
Dichloroacetate  (DCA)  is  a  simple  compound(not  a  drug)  and  can't  be  patented  in  it's  natural  form.    Nobody  wanted  to  spend  however  many  millions(billions?)  on  trials  if  they  can't  make  that  investment  back  somehow.    Plus,  it  would  be  a  bad  business  decision  to  help  bring  a  cancer  "cure"  to  the  market  when  they  make  so  much  off  of  high-priced  ineffective  "treatments"  that  sometimes  cure,  but  mostly  just  extend  life.    The  longer  you  extend  by  using  their  drug  regularly,  the  longer  they  make  money.  Simple  math  and  good  business  sense  really...<br />

Its  the  American  way,  we  need  to  preserve  profits  because  thats  the  only  way  the  Great  Pharma  companies  will  fund  leading  research.  What  do  you  think,  we  will  get  it  from  China  too?  No  Way  Hose!  Not  even  across  the  border.<br />

Yes.    Third  party  companies  would  pop  up  to  sign-off  on  (and  possibly  underwrite)  drugs.    If  they  screw  up,  they  not  only  lose  money  in  lawsuits,  but  also  lose  consumer  confidence.

<div class="cbody">The  article  brings  up  good  questions  but  it  glosses  over  many  issues  that  need  to  be  looked  at  in  more  detail.  I  will  just  deal  with  Lovastatin.  <br /> 
        I  see  the  FDA  as  serving  a  useful  function  in  the  case  when  it  bans  the  sale  of  red  yeast  rice  for  use  as  a  medicine    when  a  drug  (lovastatin)  is  made  and  tested  that  is  also  found  in  the  red  yeast  rice.  The  most  important  aspect  of  this  is  that  the  dosage  is  known  and  controlled  in  the  manufactured  drug.  This  makes  it  more  effective  and  safer  to  use.  One  caveat,  there  might  be  multiple  compounds  in  the  red  yeast  rice  that  would  make  it  more  effective  than  Lovastatin  alone.  This  may  not  be  true  with  Lovastatin  but  can  be  true  with  other  naturally  occurring  medicines.<br />
My  understanding  is  that  if  a  drug  is  derived  from  a  plant  (i.e.  naturally  occurring)  it  cannot  be  patented.  I  have  not  researched  this  thoroughly  so  the  next  discussion  is  part  guesswork.  However,  it  is  something  that  should  have  been  brought  up  in  the  article.<br />
        The  first  question  is,  how  did  Merck  get  a  patent  on  something  that  occurred  naturally?  It  looks  like  the  FDA's  attempt  to  ban  the  medicinal  use  of  red  yeast  rice  in  1997  was  overturned  by  the  courts  because  you  cannot  patent  something  that  is  naturally  occurring.  The  patent  expired  in  2001.  So,  Lovastatin  can  now  be  manufactured  generically.  Any  attempts  now  by  the  FDA  to  ban  the  medicinal  use  of  red  yeast  rice  can  be  based  simply  on  the  Lovastatin  being  more  effective  and  safer.  I  think  it's  a  good  idea  to  let  the  FDA  ban  medicinal  use  of  supplements  that  contain  approved  drugs.  However,  since  supplements  are  usually  derived  from  naturally  occurring  substances,  a  company  should  not  have  exclusive  rights  to  make  that  drug.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=460#addyourcomment" cid="460" subject="needs clarification" cid="460" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_460" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c460">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c460">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

This  is  about  the  removal  of  generic  drugs  from  the  market.  Its  about  replacing  them  with  "FDA  approved"  drugs,  that  come  with  monopoly  prices  attached.  It  is  about  removing  competition  from  the  market  place.  Misdirecting  the  conversation  to  the  "high"  (snicker)  cost  of  new  drugs  is  just  laughable.

<div class="cbody">Again,  I  have  not  researched  this  exhaustively.  If  someone  else  has  more  detail,  I  would  like  to  hear  it.<br />
Guaifenesin  is  one  of  the  drugs  that  has  been  around  awhile.  The  FDA  is  banning  all  time-release  formulations  of  Guaifensin.  The  rationale  is  that  these  drugs  are  competing  against  an  approved  drug.  The  issue  is  really  about  formulations.  The  newly  approved  drug  is  extended-release  which  has  shown  to  be  more  effective  and  safer  than  the  time-release  formulations  and  there  is  a  patent  on  the  formulation,  not  the  drug  itself.  I  don't  think  that  the  FDA  is  banning  all  the  non  extended-release  Guaifenesin  products  here.<br />
My  point  is  you  have  to  dig  down  deeper  than  the  article  does  to  understand  what  is  going  on.  The  FDA  is  giving  priority  to  enforcing  the  ban  on  unapproved  drugs  for  7  different  reasons.  This  ends  up  being  7  different  categories  for  which  a  single  unapproved  drug  would  only  fall  into  one  if  it  qualifies  at  all.  There  are  a  lot  of  different  issues  here  covering  a  lot  of  different  drugs  and  the  article  mistakenly  tries  use  a  broad  stroke  in  painting  the  whole  situation  as  just  a  grab  for  profits.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=507#addyourcomment" cid="507" subject="Guaifenesin, another example" cid="507" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_507" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c507">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c507">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">This  is  really  just  a  series  of  questions  for  the  author,  David  Fuchs,  (or  someone  else)  to  answer.<br />
The  FDA  says  the  main  problem  for  the  unapproved  quinine  sulfate  drugs  is  the  labelling.  It  should  only  be  used  for  malaria  and  "is  known  to  have  a  very  narrow  margin  of  safety  between  doses  that  are  therapeutic  in  the  treatment  of  malaria  and  doses  that  are  toxic".<br />
<br />
1).  Can't  a  drug  company  just  make  a  label  that  is  acceptable  to  be  approved  by  the  FDA?<br />
<br />
2).  Why  would  a  company  have  to  duplicate  expensive  clinical  trials  when  all  they  should  have  to  show  is  that  their  dosages  fall  into  the  known  acceptable  range  and  are  correctly  labelled?<br />
<br />
3)  How  much  does  it  cost  to  go  through  the  approval  process?  Pharmaceutical  companies  have  to  do  this  to  make  generic  drugs.  How  is  quinine  sulfate  any  different?</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=531#addyourcomment" cid="531" subject="Quinine Sulfate" cid="531" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_531" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c531">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c531">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">This  article  doesn't  do  fair  justice  to  the  intricacies  involved  in  these  decisions  and  the  measures  put  in  place  by  the  federal  government  to  encourage  the  execution  of  costly  and  risky  human  clinical  trials  by  the  private  sector.<br />
<br />
The  word  "monopoly"  gets  sloppily  throw  around  by  people  criticizing  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  not  realizing  that  pharma  is  composed  of  hundreds  of  companies  in  cutthroat  competition  with  each  other.    The  so  called  "monopolies"  on  a  given  drug  are  given,  for  a  set  time,  to  companies  who  own  the  patent  +3-5  years  of  data  exclusivity  in  exchange  for  running  costly  trials.    Without  these  incentives,  we  don't  get  new  drugs  anymore.<br />
<br />
With  respect  to  generics  companies,  they  too  have  to  run  trials...  much  less  expensive  ones,  but  trials  nonetheless.    The  FDA  is  simply  preventing  people  from  selling  supplements  as  drugs  without  providing  data  that  they  work  the  same  as  the  approved  drug.    This  is  intended  to  protect  patients!    I'm  still  able  to  get  my  tonic  water...  but  if  a  company  was  selling  this  tonic  water  as  a  cure  for  malaria,  the  FDA  had  better  make  sure  that  the  tonic  water  actually  works  as  well  as  the  quinine  sulfate  pills.    Maybe  it  does...  maybe  it  doesn't,  but  before  you  sell  it  as  a  cure,  you  have  to  prove  that  it  does.    This  is  a  very  GOOD  thing.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=590#addyourcomment" cid="590" subject="Ugh" cid="590" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_590" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c590">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c590">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">An  generic  drug  overview:<br />
I  think  it  is  a  good  thing  to  have  all  medicinal  drugs  approved  by  the  FDA.  I  also  think  it  is  a  good  thing  to  require  a  company  to  pass  checks  on  it's  manufacture  of  a  particular  medicinal  drug  (i.e.  be  approved  by  the  FDA).  The  general  public  does  not  want  drugs  to  be  too  expensive  and,  in  particular,  generic  drugs  should  never  be  expensive.  Once  a  drug  is  manufactured  by  at  least  two  companies,  the  competition  should  keep  prices  low.  So,  what's  the  problem?<br />
        The  cost  of  entering  the  market  has  to  be  low  enough  for  at  least  two  companies  to  be  involved.  I  will  not  consider  marketing  because  that  is  a  variable  cost  determined  by  a  company  itself.  Also,  if  your  drug  is,  say,  1/4  of  the  cost  of  your  competitor's  then  it  will  market  itself.  So,  the  main  investment  cost  then  is  getting  FDA  approval  and  this  has  to  be  balanced  against  the  total  size  of  the  market,  This  gives  three  categories.<br />
<br />
1)  Orphan  drugs:  No  one  wants  to  manufacture  the  drug  so  the  government  must  supply  some  artificial  incentive  disrupting  normal  market  forces.  We've  seen  an  existing  problem  concerning  that  with  Diulatin.<br />
<br />
2)  Popular  Drugs:  These  are  all  the  existing  generic  drugs  with  approval  given  by  the  FDA  to  multiple  companies.<br />
<br />
3).  Drugs  with  a  small  potential  market.  This  category  should  not  exist.  The  cost  of  getting  approval  should  never  be  so  discouraging  that  a  second  company  will  never  attempt  it.  This  is  what  I  think  the  focus  should  be  on.<br />
<br />
We  can  assume  that  drug  companies  are  greedy  and  are  always  looking  to  maximize  profit.  I  cannot  fault  the  FDA  with  deciding  to  bring  all  drugs  under  the  approval  process.  Sure,  it  disrupts  the  market  at  this  late  date  but  things  will  equilibrate  in  the  long  term  (not  too  long).  This  assumes  influence  of  big  pharma  hasn't  warped  the  process.  The  government  should  be  making  sure  that  safety  is  the  criteria  and  not  profit  for  any  approval  procedures.  I  still  can't  believe  the  ANDA  procedure  is  all  that  costly.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=683#addyourcomment" cid="683" subject="Re: Re: Quinine Sulfate" cid="683" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_683" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c683">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c683">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody"><blockquote> <i> "Why  was  Delalutin's  FDA  approval  withdrawn?"</i></blockquote>To  get  the  exact  answer  to  that,  you  would  have  to  ask  someone  who  was  in  management  of  Bristol  Meyers  Squibb  in  1999.  <br /> 
However,  what  is  known,  is  that  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06p0144/06p-0144-cp00001-Tab-02-nwl1-vol1.pdf" rel="nofollow"> BMS  asked  the  FDA  to  rescind  approval</a>  for  the  drug.<br />
A  reasonable  guess  would  be  that  since  BMS  had  decided  that  they  would  no  longer  market  it  [  probably  because  of  lawsuits  +  low  market  volume],  that  they  wanted  to  impair  any  other  company  from  using  the  approval  Squibb  had  obtained  years  before  to  bring  it  back  to  market.    Perhaps  this  was  a  bit  of  preemptive  restraint  of  the  generic  manufacturing  companies  who  the  "big-pharma"  corporations  have  frequently  sparred  with  over  the  years.<br />

<div class="cbody">That  is  getting  to  complex.  Do  not  fall  for  the  misdirection  that  <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c543" rel="nofollow"> Scotty</a>  and  <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c574" rel="nofollow"> CarlWeathersForPres</a>  are  throwing  out.  Scotty  is  trying  to  confuse  generic  drugs  with  the  cost  of  new  prescription  drugs.  CarlWeathersForPres  is  trying  to  confuse  supliments  with  prescription  drugs  and  throwing  in  fear  for  good  measure.  <br /> 
<br />
Since  the  article  is  focused  on  generic  drugs  lets  stick  with  them.  Drugs  (pill  for  this  example)  whether  they  are  OTC  or  prescription  must  meet  certain  criteria.  They  must  be  of  a  certain  purity  (90%-110%  per  pill).  They  must  disolve  and  have  80%  of  their  active  ingedients  release  in  a  certain  amount  of  time.  They  must  be  packaged  in  a  certain  way  to  prevent  degredation.  The  mass  of  active  and  inactive  ingedients  must  all  be  within  a  certain  ranges  per  pill.  In  other  words  there  are  standards.  <br /> 
<br />
Given  this  information  what  are  your  thoughts  on  the  production  of  generic  (out  of  patent)  drugs?  Who  should  be  able  to  produce  them?  How  should  we  check  for  purity  and  how  often  should  we  check?  Should  the  FDA  be  allowed  to  pull  drugs  that  meet  all  criteria?  What  should  the  criteria  be?<br />

"ANDAs  that  refer  to  DELALUTIN  (hydroxyprogesterone  caproate)  injection,  125  mg/mL  and  250  mg/mL,  may  be  approved  by  the  agency  as  long  as  they  meet  all  relevant  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  for  approval  of  ANDAs.  If  FDA  determines  that  labeling  for  these  drug  products  should  be  revised  to  meet  current  standards,  the  agency  will  advise  ANDA  applicants  to  submit  such  labeling."    Essentially,  from  reading  your  linked  article,  they  filed  paperwork  saying  they  no  longer  made  the  drug(which  is  probably  required  by  law).<br />
<br />
An  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/abbreviatednewdrugapplicationandagenerics/default.htm" rel="nofollow"> ANDA</a>  is  the  document  you  file(which  costs  relatively  little)  which  makes  it  so  you  can  use  the  safety  and  efficacy  data  from  the  original  filing(which  BMS  did).    You  linked  me  to  a  document  saying  that  anyone  could  make  the  drug  as  long  as  they  followed  the  rules  they  normally  had  to  follow.    <br /> 
<br />
I  don't  understand  the  outcry  from  doing  what  you're  supposed  to  do  by  law  and  then  allowing  someone  to  manufacture  a  drug  by  filing  some  paperwork  which  makes  it  so  they  don't  have  to  proceed  with  a  myriad  of  tests  and  pay  smaller  filing  fees.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=792#addyourcomment" cid="792" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: And!" cid="792" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_792" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c792">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c792">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">and  besides,  the  govt  funds  much  of  the  R&amp;D  required  to  develop  the  drugs  that  pharma  ends  up  getting  patents  on.  <br /> 
<br />
Those  who  claimed  that  this  is  somehow  good  for  society  did  so  without  making  any  effort  to  investigate  or  reason  through  the  issue,  they  simply  claimed  that  whatever  is  in  their  best  interest  is  in  the  public  interest  (even  though  they  really  know  better).  Many  of  those  who  lobby  for  the  existence  of  patents  under  the  pretext  that  they're  in  the  public  interest  are  the  same  liars  who  lobbied  for  privately  owned  govt  funded  patents  under  the  pretext  that  they're  in  the  public  interest  and  since  their  stated  opinion  about  privately  owned  govt  funded  patents  is  a  lie  based  on  no  evidence  with  no  effort  to  investigate/research  or  reason  through  the  issue  to  discover  the  truth,  it  is  likely  that  their  argument  that  patents  are  beneficial  to  the  public  is  made  with  the  same  lack  reasoning,  investigation,  and  supporting  evidence.<br />
<br />
Why  should  we  trust  pharmaceutical  corporations  to  decide  for  us  that  patents  are  in  the  public  interest  when  patents  are  clearly  in  their  private  interest  and  hence  they  have  a  conflict  of  interest.  The  decision  about  whether  or  not  patents  should  exist  should  largely  be  made  without  their  input  (not  that  they  can't  give  their  input,  just  that  the  decision  should  mostly  ignore  their  input)  since  their  input  is  more  likely  to  serve  their  personal  interests  over  the  public  interest.  But  that's  not  how  our  system  works,  the  way  our  system  works  is  that  special  interests  have  a  disproportionately  large  influence  over  these  decisions  when  it  is  them  that  should  have  a  disproportionately  small  influence  due  to  their  conflict  of  interest.<br />
<br />
Now,  you  may  argue  that  the  public  also  has  an  interest  in  the  matter,  but  that's  fine,  because  the  purpose  of  government  should  be  to  serve  the  <i> public</i>  interest  and  who's  to  better  decide  whats  in  the  public  interest  than  the  public?  (not  the  government  and  certainly  not  pharmaceutical  corporations).</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=847#addyourcomment" cid="847" subject="Re: Re: Ugh" cid="847" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_847" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c847">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c847">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

When  national  health  care  fully  kicks  in  who  is  going  to  pay  the  bill  for  these  new  price  inflated  drugs,  many  that  have  not  been  inspected  or  even  tested?  Tax  payers  are  going  to  foot  the  bill  of  course.

Estimates  by  whom,  the  pharma  industry?  and  why  should  I  believe  them?<br />
<br />
These  are  inflated  numbers,  we  know  that  now.<br />

Besides,  the  U.S.  govt  usually  funds  drug  discovery  up  to  the  point  where  something  is  shown  likely  not  to  be  a  failure.  The  U.S.  govt  takes  all  the  risks  and  after  it's  shown  that  something  shows  promise,  then  pharma  takes  over  from  there.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=944#addyourcomment" cid="944" subject="Re: Re: Quinine Sulfate" cid="944" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_944" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c944">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c944">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">The  guaifenesin  issue  predates  the  2006  initiative  on  tightening  the  regulation  of  Unapproved  Drugs.    The  FDA  moved  against  guaifenesin  manufacturers  in  2002.    Adams  Labs  came  to  the  FDA  and  offered  to  do  detailed  testing  of  an  existing  drug,  but  in  a  new  sustained  release  product  --  Mucinex.    Prior  to  that  time,  guaifenesin  had  been  primarily  sold  as  a  generic  immediate  release  drug.  In  2002,  virtually  all  guaifenesin,  except  Mucinex,  disappeared  from  the  market  overnight.    After  a  couple  of  years,  immediate  release  guaifenesin  reappeared  in  the  US  market,  and  I  don't  know  the  details  surrounding  the  FDA's  regulation  of  that  return  to  market.<br />
What  I  do  know  is  that  when  generic  guaifenesin  disappeared,  Mucinex  was  sold  at  about  4X  the  cost  of  the  preceding  generic  products.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=988#addyourcomment" cid="988" subject="Re: Guaifenesin, another example" cid="988" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_988" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c988">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c988">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

KV  Pharmaceutical  is  the  only  company  currently  allowed  to  produce  and  market  hydroxyprogesterone  for  the  treatment  of  halting  premature  labor.    That  is  a  monopoly.<br />
No  the  FDA  is  not  preventing  anyone  else  from  ending  KV  Pharmaceutical's  monopoly  by  filing  their  own  ANDA,  but  KV  Pharmaceutical  wouldn't  have  the  monopoly  at  all  were  it  not  for  FDA  regulatory  activity.<br />
<br />
Let  me  try  again  to  explain  to  you  how  this  happened.  <br /> 
<br />
The  FDA  certainly  did  withdraw  approval  for  the  distribution  of  hydroxyprogesterone    in  2000.<br />
In  2006,  the  FDA  issued  a  determination  that  the  withdrawal  had  been  for  non-safety  reasons,  and  that  therefore  they  would  allow  an  ANDA.<br />
<br />
In  the  period  since  that  time,  the  FDA  has  forced  compounding  pharmacies  from  the  market  for  this  drug.    Compounding  pharmacies  generally  rarely  advertise  their  services  to  physicians,  and  definitely  not  to  patients.    They  produce  the  compounds  on  a  case  by  case  basis  at  the  request  of  physician.    Nonetheless  that  is  sufficient  to  provide  an  alternative  source  if  the  price  of  a  drug  is  deemed  exorbitant.<br />
<b>It  is  the  FDA's  act  of  preventing  the  compounding  pharmacies  from  selling  hydroxyprogesterone  that  allows  the  KV  Pharmaceutical  to  enjoy  monopoly  market  leverage</b>  needed  to  charge  $30,000  for  a  treatment  regimen.    <br /> 
<br />
Sure  anyone  else  can  submit  an  ANDA  for  this  drug,  because  KV  Pharmaceutical    doesn't  have  a  patent,  but  that  doesn't  mean  there  isn't  a  regulatory  monopoly  at  this  moment.    You  seem  to  be  equating  monopoly  with  patent  protection.    I  am  telling  you  there  are  other  paths  to  monopoly.    <br /> 
<br />
You  should  realize  that  filing  an  ANDA  isn't  necessarily  a  trivial  endeavor  which  will  be  automatically  be  approved  in  a  very  short  time.    Testing  and  verification  of  results  is  still  required  and  then  paperwork  must  still  be  presented  and  committees  must  review  it.    <br /> 
Observe  that  it  took  5  years  from  the  time  that  the  FDA  issued  its  determination  that  it  would  allow  an  ANDA  until  the  first  ANDA  was  approved  this  year.    <br /> 
At  this  point,  there  is  no  telling  how  long  it  will  be  till  the  next  one  is  approved,  but  until  it  does  there  is  no  competition  for  KV  Pharmaceutical.<br />
That  is  the  definition  of  a  monopoly</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=1121#addyourcomment" cid="1121" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: And!" cid="1121" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1121" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c1121">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c1121">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">If  I  tell  you  that  you  now  have  to  pay  100x  the  'normal  cost'  for  the  'same  basic  treatment'  you  would  have  no  problem  with  this,  since  the  'new'  formula  is  FDA  approved?<br />
<br />
Does  it  really  matter  what  the  reasons  for  the  ban's  are  if  there  is  no  significant  risk  associated  with  the  items  being  banned  (if  there  was  they  would  have  been  pulled  years  ago,  right?)<br />
<br />
This  one  is  being  banned  because  Joe  Senator's  son's  company  makes  a  medical  version  that  sells  for  100x  the  price,  but  still  costs  us  1/100th  to  manufacture.    That  one  is  being  banned  because  Charlie  Congressman  was  'lobbied'  extensively  (he  got  a  new  cabin  cruiser,  a  vacation  home,  and  a  10  year  supply  so  he  doesn't  have  to  pay  the  markup).<br />
<br />
These  reasons  make  just  about  as  much  sense  as  some  of  the  ones  the  FDA  is  pushing  (probably  more  if  someone  had  the  actual  details....  where's  wikileaks  when  you  need  them)...</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=1353#addyourcomment" cid="1353" subject="Re: Guaifenesin, another example" cid="1353" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1353" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c1353">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c1353">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">"Any  attempts  now  by  the  FDA  to  ban  the  medicinal  use  of  red  yeast  rice  can  be  based  simply  on  the  Lovastatin  being  more  effective  and  safer."<br />
<br />
The  evidence/studies  on  the  matter  support  the  opposite.  <br /> 
<br />
Lets  just  ban  pure  water  because  it  cures  dehydration  and  is  hence  a  drug  and  companies  sell  alternative  ways  to  hydrate  us,  like  Gatorade,  and  they're    safer  and  more  effective.  Not  enough  studies  on  the  benefits  of  water.  Maybe  we  need  FDA  approval  for  Gatorade  and  for  water  because  they're  being  used  as  drugs  to  cure  dehydration.<br />
<br />
What  about  apples,  they  have  vitamin  C,  but  who  cares,  we  need  more  studies  on  it,  and  there  aren't  enough  FDA  approved  clinical  trials.  After  all,  apples  are  good  for  you,  they  provide  a  health  benefit,  along  with  most  other  foods,  and  those  health  benefits  are  medicinal  in  nature  and  can  perhaps  also  be  provided  more  safely  and  effectively  with  FDA  approved  pharmaceutical  drugs.  Food  cures  starvation,  it's  a  drug,  so  lets  just  ban  foods  and  replace  them  all  with  FDA  approved  drugs.<br />
<br />
The  FDA  banned  red  yeast  rice  for  absolutely  no  good  reason  (or  at  least  red  yeast    rice  naturally  containing  more  than  just  trace  amounts  of  lovastatin),  no  different  than  banning  apples  and  bananas  for  any  health  benefits  they  provide.  All  the  studies  on  it  showed  that  it  was  safer  and  more  effective  than  pharmaceutical  alternatives.    Cholesterol  lowering  Phara  drugs  have  been  responsible  for  killing  hundreds  of  people  before  being  taken  off  the  market  (ie:  Bayers  drug  Baycol),  red  yeast  rice  hasn't  been  responsible  for  a  single  death.  From  what  I  remember,  it  was  a  pharmaceutical  corporation  that  initially  petitioned  them  to  ban  it  because  it  competed  with  what  they  sold,  and  that's  when  they  started  their  vendetta  against  it,  though  no  recent  articles  on  the  matter  seem  to  indicate  so.<br />
<br />
You  can  read  more  about  red  yeast  rice  on  Wikipedia.<br />
<br />
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_yeast_rice' rel='nofollow' rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_yeast_rice</a><br />
<br />
Red  yeast  rice  is  actually  shown  to  save  lives.  If  the  government  really  cared  about  safety,  they  would  ban  cigarettes,  which  has  killed  far  more  people  (in  opposed  to  zero),  but    health  freedom  is  perfectly  OK  so  long  as  it  helps  big  corporations.  When  it  harms  them,  it's  not  acceptable.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=1369#addyourcomment" cid="1369" subject="Re: needs clarification" cid="1369" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1369" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c1369">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c1369">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">"I  see  the  FDA  as  serving  a  useful  function  in  the  case  when  it  bans  the  sale  of  red  yeast  rice  for  use  as  a  medicine  when  a  drug  (lovastatin)  is  made  and  tested  that  is  also  found  in  the  red  yeast  rice.  The  most  important  aspect  of  this  is  that  the  dosage  is  known  and  controlled  in  the  manufactured  drug.  This  makes  it  more  effective  and  safer  to  use."<br />
<br />
What's  the  appropriate  dose  of  apples  before  too  many  are  bad  for  you?  How  many  should  you  take  so  that  they  cure  various  vitamin  deficiencies  yet  don't  harm  you.<br />
<br />
If  I  want  to  take  substance  X  for  problem  Y,  that's  MY  business.  No  one  is  forcing  you  to  take  it.  You  don't  want  to  take  red  yeast  rice  because  of  xyz  reasons,  that's    your  business,  I  can't  force  you  to  do  it.  But  you  have  absolutely  NO  right  to  tell  me  what  I  can  and  can't  take  or  sell.  I  am  in  a  better  position  to  determine  what's  in  my  best  interest  than  you  or  even  the  FDA.  Sure,  it  could  harm  me,  but  again,  that's  my  business,  it's  no  one  elses  business  and  the  FDA  needs  to  mind  its  own  business.  <br /> 
<br />
They  do  have  an  important  job  though,  to  make  sure  that  everything  that's  in  the  bottle  is  on  the  label  and  to  make  sure  that  everything  that's  on  the  label  is  in  the  bottle  so  that  I  know  exactly  what  I'm  buying.  Other  than  that,  mind  your  own  business,  let  me  worry  about  my  own  safety  and  let  me  weigh  the  pros,  cons,  and  risks  of  what  I  take.</div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?cid=1394#addyourcomment" cid="1394" subject="Re: needs clarification" cid="1394" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1394" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml#c1394">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20110324/02181913605/fda-suddenly-bans-drugs-that-have-been-market-decades.shtml?threaded=true#c1394">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]
