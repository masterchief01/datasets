<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/simplest-apple-tart/" title="simplest apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2064/1881174670_332cc33ae6.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="simplest apple tart" /></a></p>
Apples at their simplest can be their very finest. Sure, I love an oozy, heavily spiced and lidded apple pie, but I also think there is something matchless about apples, butter and sugar, baked until bubbly. This classic apple tart is from Alice Waters, but she says that it was actually Jacques Pepin who created it at Chez Panisse more than 20 years ago. I can see why they&#8217;ve never gotten tired of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1542357466/" title="tart dough"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2350/1542357466_01437f5c35_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="tart dough" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1881146566/" title="pate brisee"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/1881146566_3bb9cf2555_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="pate brisee" /></a></p>
<p>You start by making a very simple pate brisee, yes, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/10/cranberry-caramel-and-almond-tart/">that kind</a>, but this one doesn&#8217;t demand precision. You&#8217;re going to want to roll it out really, really thin. Now, the original recipe suggested that you use a tart pan, but I think you can skip it, and go <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/unbendy-brisee/">galette-style</a>. </p>
<p><span id="more-331"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880328197/" title="peeled and cored apples"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2113/1880328197_8d812ea3b8_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="peeled and cored apples" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880331467/" title="sliced apples"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2338/1880331467_a647238959_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="sliced apples" /></a></p>
<p>Next, peel apples. The original recipe suggested more than I needed, not that I complained about having slices to snack on. I like to halve them and use a melon baller, which is getting a big workout <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/roasted-stuffed-onions/">this week</a>, to remove the cores. Save all the peels and cores.</p>
<p>I like to tightly armadillo them. Keeping them together helps when you want to lay them out, as you can just lightly tilt them and they&#8217;ll fan out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880334777/" title="apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2139/1880334777_f9b2d52013_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="apple tart" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880337975/" title="apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2095/1880337975_8c9b622f08_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="apple tart" /></a></p>
<p>Like so. Pull the excess crust over the apples, crimping it at intervals. Brush the crust and apples with two tablespoons of melted butter. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880341463/" title="apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2197/1880341463_4ff636237c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="apple tart" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880356935/" title="apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2389/1880356935_34409eb9b4_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="apple tart" /></a></p>
<p>Sprinkle it with a few tablespoons of sugar, then bake it for almost an hour, rotating it frequently until it&#8217;s a deep, golden brown. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880344363/" title="apple syrup"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2190/1880344363_9662461870_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="apple syrup" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880346987/" title="strained apple syrup"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2239/1880346987_5c45e5c357_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="strained apple syrup" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, boil all of the reserved peels and cores in a sugar water until it reduces to a syrup. Strain it. Brush the syrup lightly over the tart, hot from the oven.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1880350081/" title="apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2348/1880350081_08ef85905b_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="apple tart" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1881174670/" title="apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2064/1881174670_332cc33ae6_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="apple tart" /></a></p>
<p>See if you can keep away until guests arrive. It might even be the hardest thing you&#8217;ve done that day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/1881180822/" title="apple tart"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2316/1881180822_e14bf596b4.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="apple tart" /></a></p>
<p>Serve with vanilla ice cream, lightly sweetened softly whipped cream or a dollop of creme fraiche, either alone or stirred into whipped cream. Make plans to repeat it with pears next week, er, tomorrow. Let this be your go-to recipe for everything awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Alice Waters&#8217;s Apple Tart</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.life.com/Life/recipe/0,26385,1531843,00.html">Found buried deeply within my recipe bookmarks folder!</a></p>
<p><em>Dough: </em><br />
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour<br />
1/2 teaspoon sugar<br />
1/8 teaspoon salt<br />
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, just softened, cut in 1/2-inch pieces<br />
3 1/2 tablespoons chilled water</p>
<p><em>Filling: </em><br />
2 pounds apples (Golden Delicious or another tart, firm variety), peeled, cored (save peels and cores), and sliced<br />
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br />
5 tablespoons sugar </p>
<p><em>Glaze:</em><br />
1/2 cup sugar </p>
<p>MIX flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; add 2 tablespoons of the butter. Blend in a mixer until dough resembles coarse cornmeal. Add remaining butter; mix until biggest pieces look like large peas. </p>
<p>DRIBBLE in water, stir, then dribble in more, until dough just holds together. Toss with hands, letting it fall through fingers, until it&#8217;s ropy with some dry patches. If dry patches predominate, add another tablespoon water. Keep tossing until you can roll dough into a ball. Flatten into a 4-inch-thick disk; refrigerate. After at least 30 minutes, remove; let soften so it&#8217;s malleable but still cold. Smooth cracks at edges. On a lightly floured surface, roll into a 14-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Dust excess flour from both sides with a dry pastry brush. </p>
<p>PLACE dough in a lightly greased 9-inch round tart pan, or simply on a parchment-lined baking sheet if you wish to go free-form, or galette-style with it. Heat oven to 400&#176;F. (If you have a pizza stone, place it in the center of the rack.) </p>
<p>OVERLAP apples on dough in a ring 2 inches from edge if going galette-style, or up to the sides if using the tart pan. Continue inward until you reach the center. Fold any dough hanging over pan back onto itself; crimp edges at 1-inch intervals. </p>
<p>BRUSH melted butter over apples and onto dough edge. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over dough edge and the other 3 tablespoons over apples. (Deb note: I found it nearly impossible to coat it with this much sugar, so I used a little less&#8211;more like 3 tablespoons. It made a lightly sweet tart, which we found perfect.)</p>
<p>BAKE in center of oven until apples are soft, with browned edges, and crust has caramelized to a dark golden brown (about 45 minutes), making sure to rotate tart every 15 minutes. </p>
<p>MAKE glaze: Put reserved peels and cores in a large saucepan, along with sugar. Pour in just enough water to cover; simmer for 25 minutes. Strain syrup through cheesecloth. </p>
<p>REMOVE tart from oven, and slide off parchment onto cooling rack. Let cool at least 15 minutes. </p>
<p>BRUSH glaze over tart, slice, and serve. </p>

				<p>Hi Deb, I don&#8217;t know what in particular inspired me to finally post a comment&#8211; maybe the novelty of being first&#8211; but I&#8217;m finally doing it.  I&#8217;ve been hooked on food blogs since I &#8220;discovered&#8221; them about a year ago&#8211; figures it would happen when I move to Japan and can&#8217;t get a hold of many of the ingredients I see on your blog and others.  You always have such delicious looking and sounding dishes and I love the way you write&#8211; I even spent a good portion of May reading through all your old Smitten posts in between doing the more productive things I should have been doing (no offense).  I&#8217;ve made a bunch of things from your site and they have all been oishi as they say in Japan.  This looks like another stunner of a recipe.</p>
<p>I actually have a question about your camera.  I know you love your digital Rebel and macro lens and this may sound silly but do you just point and shoot or do you manually set each photograph&#8211; I&#8217;ve been debating getting a digital SLR but am wondering how much better it is than a good quality point-and-shoot.  Thus, how are your photos shot? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, what a sensational looking apple tart &#8211; not to mention its healthy and look easy to make too.  I&#8217;ve tried apple tart once, by this aussie chef Curtis Stone after watching it on TV.  As it turned out, total disaster.  Will try yours out this weekend.  Thanks again!</p>

				<p>There is no way that would last more than a few minutes in my kitchen. I love anything warm and apple-y, and actually prefer simple tarts to gooey pies.</p>

				<p>I made an apple torte a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised at how easy and tasty it was as an alternative to apple pie. Now, you&#8217;ve given me another elegant option. Thanks for the user friendly pics as well!</p>

				<p>I adore this simple apple tart.  I used to make it all the time when my son was little and I would bring it in for his class to share.  Most of his class mates said they preferred a full lidded apple pie.  We did an informal survey for apple day and parents brought in all different kinds of apples, had the pie and tart, also apple butter.  It was pretty interesting what the kids thought.  They all thought they would like the red apples better, but it was the multi colored Galas, and Pink ladies most enjoyed.  The kids ended up having an easier time with the tart over the pie.  They also realized it tasted the same, just less gooey and more hands on than a full pie.</p>

				<p>Do you think I could freeze this and then bake it a day later?  This would be great to take to my boyfriend&#8217;s family for Thanksgiving?  (Although I don&#8217;t know if I want to compete with bf&#8217;s mom&#8217;s pie crust-making ability.)</p>

				<p>Sooooo good! I made it last night and am now enjoying it again for breakfast. It was easy and delicious&#8230; except my glaze didn&#8217;t work. I si,mmered it for nearly two hours and it was never anything more than weak watery apple juice. Too much water, maybe? Anyway the tart was and is spectacular even plain.</p>

				<p>Made this this weekend and it came out great &#8211; beautiful and delicious!  I had the same problem with the glaze as a previous poster &#8211; after 45 minutes of boiling, it was still pretty thin.  I solved this by taking some of the (too thin) glaze and whisking in confectioner&#8217;s sugar to thicken it up.  This worked really well.  Also, I made a 1 1/2 recipe of the dough, which was just enough for the 10&#8243; tart pan that I used.</p>

				<p>Hi there !</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of your blog and of your amazing recipes. I tried this one last week, and it was a big success at home :D</p>
<p>I wanted to post about it on my blog (not a food blog, and soon to come), but I baked it at night, and it was all eaten by morning, so my pictures are really lame :( May I use one of yours ? I&#8217;ll of course put a link to your flicker and your website, and indicate your post as the original one :) AND next time I&#8217;ll make sure to save some food for the picture :P</p>
<p>Please let me know, and thanks again for your posts, especially this month, the everyday update is great ! :D</p>

				<p>I made this tart galette style for Thanksgiving after I discovered the rolled out dough wasn&#8217;t big enough for my 12&#8243; tart pan.  Not only was it fabulous, it was cute.  All the teenagers at the table thought my dessert was the coolest!  I topped it with cinnamon whipped cream &#8211; hit the spot.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.</p>

				<p>WOW!  So simple and right up my alley!  I usually get ready to make a standard recipe, then hit the web for any interesting twists &#8211; and lucky me, I found Smitten!!!  We are simple &#8211; mostly organic and easy eaters, so this tart was easier than the one I make&#8230;(I must admit, that I have an even easier short cut &#8211; especially, when you need to make a dessert for &#8220;out the door&#8221; in an hour!) I can&#8217;t wait to find time and look through the website!  ..Only thing is that I get homesick thinking about NYC and my daughter!</p>

				<p>Hi! Tried your recipe and it was great. Added vanilla essence as well to the glaze and walnuts to the pastry which was a REALLY GREAT COMBINATION! (: got a great response from my family members.<br />
Only one thing: Was wondering whether you had the same problem, because I left it in the fridge and when I came back that evening, it didnt look as golden brown anymore, in fact it turned a little limp and old looking (despite still tasting nice and getting great response from the people who tried it). How do you ensure that the apple doesnt turn into that moldy looking colour? Would appreciate it if you could email me/reply me! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</p>

				<p>I tried this recipe, and it was both easy and fantastic.  I added grated ginger and lemon zest to both the pie and the glaze which added some zing &#8211; everyone loved it!  I prefer it to apple pie, since the focus is on the apples, and not the crust.  So amazing.</p>

				<p>A friend of mine made the original version by Jacques Pepin once, it was stunning! it actually calls for apple sauce and then layers of apples on top. I don&#8217;t have the recipe unfortunately, but if anybody has a copy of it should definitely give it a try!</p>

				<p>Hi Leslie &#8212; The print function should be working (just tested it). Use <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/simplest-apple-tart/print/" rel="nofollow">this link</a> if the button won&#8217;t work for you.</p>

				<p>Delicious, and it was as pretty as the picture.  Love the fan techinque.  I needed a little more pastry crust then the recipie made, but covered the tarte dish and sides just fine.  What a great way to use fresh picked apples.</p>

				<p>I made this with 2 Honey Crisp and 2 Gala apples as well as one very small pear. I had some left over apple (probably only need three apples, not 4) and it turned out wonderful! I even used cheater crust from the store. The whole family found it to be delicious!</p>

				<p>Just made this over the weekend with some Mutsu apples I got at the farmer&#8217;s market. (If you see Mutsus around, try them! They are fantastic for baking because they really hold their shape, but they&#8217;re also my favorite snacking apple, perfectly crisp, not too sweet, not too tart.) I also ended up with a fairly watery glaze&#8211;I&#8217;ll use less water next time, and there definitely will be a next time. But I just didn&#8217;t use a ton of the glaze and this still tasted (and looked) amazing. And it couldn&#8217;t have been simpler. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!</p>

				<p>Why the pizza stone in the middle of the rack?  Do I take it out when I&#8217;m ready to bake the tart/pie/galette?  Or do I leave it in the oven?  Do I put whatever is holding apple creation on top of the pizza stone if I&#8217;m supposed to leave it in the over or on the rack above it?</p>

				<p>Simple and perfect. Mine even looked almost as pretty as yours &#8212; all these years I&#8217;ve been making apple tarts and never fanned the slices that way.  I added a few slivers of ginger and a half-teaspoon of apricot jam to the syrup, and used even less sugar.</p>

				<p>A delicious, easy apple tart, and the crust is to DIE for. I&#8217;ve made it twice now. You can even make it in a toaster oven with a bake function &#8211; I did the other night, because I needed the oven for roasting the Zuni Cafe Roast Chicken! Impress your boyfriend&#8217;s mom with this one!</p>

				<p>This recipe was great.  I tried it for Thanksgiving per recommendation from a friend.  It was my second time trying any sort of dough- which, I admit, I was rather intimidated by at first.  My first attempt at making a dough (for pierogi- almost 3 years ago!) was a complete failure. I am a pretty good baker and make excellent cakes and other desserts, yet I was scared of making a simple pat brisee!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I got the courage to try this, because it came out fantastic.  The dough was perfect- golden and the right amount of flakeyness without falling apart, but was not dough-y in the slightest.   I will be using this recipe again and again, not only for apples, but other fruits as well. </p>
<p>I also love the idea of using the apple cores and skins to make a syrup!  The syrup was probably my favourite part- so much delicious apple flavour.  I can&#8217;t believe I never had thought of this or heard of it.  I usually don&#8217;t skin my fruits but I think now I have incentive to just to make such a wondeful syrup.  I&#8217;ll definitely be experimenting with other fruits (in fact, right now, I&#8217;m using pear and apple cores and peels to put on top of small pear and apple tarts I&#8217;m making.) </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing the wonderful recipe, and your pictures are very lovely.  I think I will be checking out the rest of your blog/website now. (:</p>

				<p>First time I made this, it was for my next door neighbor during Thanksgiving&#8217;s weekend.  My neighbor absolutely felt in love with it.  Strange thing was, I didn&#8217;t even have a taste of it!  My neighbor asked if it is ok for them to give me the money and I would continue to bake this tart again, again, again, and again for them!</p>
<p>A month or so later, I found the time to bake this tart, this time, it was definitely for me to try!  I must admit, this tart had me felt in love with it so quickly no words could describe!  I absolutely love how simple the ingredients are put together to create such wonderful tart&#8230;.Thanks so much for sharing!</p>

				<p>I made this last night but used two granny smith apples and two golden delicious apples. After baking it it came out sooo tart from the granny smith that I was so turned off. This morning I tried it again and it tasted wonderful&#8230; how weird huh. Next time I make this I am sticking to Golden Delicious apples!</p>

				<p>Outside of the occassional muffin I don&#8217;t bake. Period.<br />
Saw this and thought, &#8216;Hey, I could do this.&#8217; And I did &#8211; tonight, in fact.<br />
I used 1.5 lbs apples, just under 3 Tbsps sugar and skipped the glaze entirely. Also sprinkled on a bit of nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice.<br />
This tart tasted just like that big, takes forever to assemble apple pie but was amazingly easy to prepare.<br />
The crust &#8211; delicate, flaky, delicious.<br />
Definite keeper.</p>

				<p>oh my gosh, this was absolutely delish<br />
i made this tart except halved the recipe because i had one apple and a leftover peach &#8211; just cut them up and made the tart very rustic and hand-formed<br />
THE CRUST WAS SO BUTTERY AND YUMMY!<br />
also, i don&#8217;t have a mixer, but just used a fork to make it &#8211; i can&#8217;t bake and i made this and it was good! if you have a few ingredients and really want something sweet and delicious&#8230;make this!</p>

				<p>Hot weather can be very difficult for pastry crusts because it melts the butter, rather than keeping it in cold bits throughout the flour. Try it again, but keep the dough cold cold cold, putting it back in the fridge or freezer for few minutes whenever it feels any less than very cold to the touch.</p>

<p>I want to make this with a small bit of almond paste (like this one:http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/French-Apple-Almond-Tart-4665) spread on the bottom&#8230;do you foresee any problems? I am thinking of making this free form too since I don&#8217;t have a tart pan.</p>

				<p>This was so easy and so delicious! I loved the apple glaze, which was like an intensely apple-flavored honey. The candied apple peels that were left over from making the glaze were also tasty. I made my tart with 3 tbs sugar which came out perfect for me (I also tend to like things on the tart side). When I make it again the only thing I will change is to really cram it full of apples since the apples shrink more than I expected. Looking at your pictures now I don&#8217;t think I put as many apples in as you did.</p>

				<p>I just made this for a dinner party last night, and it was a hit!  I did make 50% more crust, which seemed perfect.  I used Pink Lady and Jonagold apples.  Both were delicious and held up well to baking.  I think the trick with the glaze is to use the very minimum of water needed to cover the apple peels and cores.  It&#8217;s not thick like jelly, but thicker than juice.  It was a tasty glaze, and my 7 year old daughter thought the leftovers were just about the best thing ever.  She wanted to drink it straight!<br />
Thanks for another great recipe, Deb!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
I&#8217;m planning to make this for Thanksgiving. Any way I can assemble it the night before up to the baking step? Or can I bake it and put it in the fridge overnight and bring to room temperature the following day? Help! I have too much to cook to do it on Thanksgiving.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb.  Just found this recipe and had a question about the dough.  You say you&#8217;re going to start by making a &#8216;pate brisee&#8217; and you link over to your cranberry, caramel &amp; almond tart.  But that dough and this dough have very different ingredients.  Are these two doughs interchangeable?</p>

				<p>Hi Rebecca &#8212; Yes, that is confusing. The doughs are a little bit different, that one more cookie-like and I&#8217;d actually (now) recommend this first. I will update that link. Thanks for pointing it out.</p>

				<p>A year later, and I made it again for Thanksgiving, and it was just as wonderful.  Used Gala apples (I think), and discovered that even if the galette turnover is messy it&#8217;s still beautiful. I used leftover peel juice to make oatmeal the next morning.  Happy Thanksgiving, Deb.</p>

				<p>I made this tart for a second time tonight (first time was last year) and made a few minor changes&#8211; I sprinkled the apples with about a teaspoon of kosher salt, browned the butter (as you once said, brown food tastes best!), and used vanilla sugar for sprinkling.  I thought these changes made for an even more delicious tart!  Thanks for a great recipe.</p>

				<p>I just finished making this and it&#8217;s delicious&#8211; the crust is all flaky and nice, and even my boyfriend liked it when he tried it (and he is excessively picky). Also, this is the first pie-type thing I&#8217;ve ever made successfully (I&#8217;ve made a very mediocre crumble before, meh) so I&#8217;m excited.</p>

				<p>So here I am almost three years later commenting on this post. I made the tart and it is now sitting in the middle of my dining room table waiting for us to finish dinner so we can devour it. It is gorgeous! I&#8217;ve been wanting to make it forever and I&#8217;m thrilled that I did it today. The glaze is brilliant. I can&#8217;t wait to taste the whole thing.

				<p>I love that when I make your recipes they actually look like the photos you posted! Anyway, another great recipe. This was really easy and delicious. I used all granny smith apples and it was a little too tart (not for me but maybe for others). I would use a mix next time. I also had trouble boiling down the apple syrup to an actual syrup&#8211;took close to an hour, but eventually it worked&#8211;was still pretty watery, but sweet. Crust was thin, flaky and perfect! Baked it for my boyfriend&#8217;s family, who are very picky, and they loved it!</p>

				<p>In <i>general</i>, I get 6 4-inch tarts from a standard 9-inch tart pan recipe. This isn&#8217;t in a standard tart pan, but would fit in one. You can still fold over/in the dough for a rustic look.</p>

				<p>This is in the oven right now!! The heat in my 4th floor apartment killed my crust and it spent about an hour off/on in the fridge. I&#8217;m considering storing one old cutting board in the fridge and using that to roll crusts out in the (warm) future. Has anyone tried this? Thoughts?</p>

				<p>Just had to pipe in because you have truly helped me to overcome my fear of making a pastry crust. I&#8217;ve made your savory ricotta tart about six times now and it&#8217;s much loved and requested. Today I made the pate brisee and used apples that my neighbor lady gave to me. It&#8217;s in the oven right now and nearly done and smelling divine. I CAN MAKE A CRUST! ::::happydance:::: Thanks for the inspiration, the beautiful photographs and the spot-on verbiage that helped get over my crust phobia. </p>
<p>Oh, also wanted to add that using the cores and the skins to make a simple syrup is simply ingenious! I love that nothing goes to waste.</p>

				<p>I made this for a dinner party with friends over the weekend. I used pears and despite my best attempts I could not fit 2lbs of fruit in the tart. I also had a hard time fitting 5 tbsp of sugar on the fruit so only used 3. However, my pears were still quite firm so in retrospect I might have used more sugar or been more generous with the glaze. It was quite a hit when served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make this again</p>

				<p>This is a great easy tart recipe&#8211;not too sweet and a very flaky crust.</p>
<p>I did the crust in the food processor, and did the apples slightly differently (which I think I&#8217;d seen in a French bakery)&#8211;do the outer edge like the photo, but in the center, lay the apples in their side to make a pinwheel and do 2 or 3 layers (to come up as high as the outer layer). It&#8217;s very pretty.</p>
<p>Since I used apples with reddish skins my glaze was pink and looked great on the apples. I boiled it down even more after I strained it so it was nice and syrupy. I also used less sugar on the top&#8211;probably 3 tablespoons.</p>
<p>Plan to make this again ASAP!</p>

				<p>Made this as directed but also poured 1-2 Tbsp of amaretto over the top in addition to the glaze. The next day, I made the same thing with pears and it was also amazing.</p>

				<p>I did this tart this weekend for my husband and myself.  I did it in the galette form.  It was okay, but not a stunner for us.  I think it just wasn&#8217;t what we prefer and did not find anything wrong with the recipe.</p>
<p>I did make one change in that I made a brown sugar streusel and sprinkled it on the top instead of the 5 Tbsp of sugar.  Actually I found the streusel topping and the apples to be the best part!  (I am slowly coming to the conclusion that I do not like traditional flaky pie crust.  I only like graham cracker or crushed cookie pie crusts.)</p>
<p>But one thing that I learned and really liked is the way Deb slices her apples.  I usually slice them vertically, but I liked them better when sliced horizontally as shown in the photos above.</p>

				<p>I just made this and it was so good.  All I had was flour, sugar, butter and apples (college student) so this recipe was perfect.  I didn&#8217;t even have measuring cups, a rolling pin, or even a cookie sheet and it still turned out beautifully.  I did add cinnamon because I found some in the cupboard.  For having so few ingredients I can&#8217;t believe how good it was.  It is already gone.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that apple seeds contain arsenic. I did not use the apple cores when I made the glaze, just the skins instead. Here&#8217;s a link for more info:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/apples.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/apples.asp</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend avoiding the seeds.</p>

				<p>Yes, apple seeds contain a tiny amount of <em>cyanide</em>. It would be nearly impossible to hurt yourself eating them. From the article, the &#8220;number of apple seeds it takes to pack a lethal punch is therefore huge&#8221;. Were it otherwise, every single apple would come with a bright red warning label &#8220;DO NOT EAT SEEDS&#8221; and it would be a public health nightmare. Furthermore, the cyanide in seeds is not reachable by humans unless pulverized; our digestive track is literally incapable of breaking these down. </p>
<p>That said, I completely understand if even the proximity to cyanide is enough reason to scare someone into removing the seeds from their glaze. It&#8217;s totally up to the cook. But the recipe is not unsafe as printed because of this.</p>

				<p>Oh dear &#8211; my pastry attempt was a complete disaster! It cane together to a ball nicely to be refrigerated but just wouldn&#8217;t roll out and lift into a tart pan without falling apart.  I tried putting it back in the fridge and starting again but no joy.  I had to resort to rolling it on a piece of silicon paper and going down that route, but even then I couldn&#8217;t lift the edges over without them breaking!</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s in the oven now, and smells divine, so it&#8217;ll taste good I&#8217;m sure! I&#8217;m determined to crack it, so more flour next time? Less water? Help from pastry experts welcome!</p>

				<p>I made this for an oscar party last night and it was a giant success. giant. it couldn&#8217;t have been more successful. I did it in the galette form and it was crispy and tender and flaky all over the place. I doused it a bit in the glaze but didn&#8217;t use too much. The first time I tried this with a different dough recipe and this one definitely worked out much better! every party I go to is now getting an apple galette. ooc delicious!</p>

				<p>oh deb&#8230;thank you so much for sharing this with us! my boyfriend&#8217;s family is coming over tomorrow to eat with us so i made this tonight to have in advance (because i&#8217;m slow cooking a chicken in the dutch oven tomorrow and didn&#8217;t want the galette to smell like chicken haha)&#8230; it just came out of the oven and looks divine.  I&#8217;m going to do the syrup glaze tomorrow when I reheat the tart for their visit.  I&#8217;m also making your wedge salad and stuffed mushrooms (the bacon ones not the sundried tomato ones)&#8230; yes, I am mildly obsessed with your blog&#8230;</p>
<p>thanks again!</p>
