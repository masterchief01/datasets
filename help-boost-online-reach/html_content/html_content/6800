	- Emperor Nero Claudius Caesar's (54-68) cook, Gaius, is often credited with 
	discovering the first sausage. It was the custom of the time to starve the 
	pigs one week before cooking and eating them. According to legend, one pig 
	was brought out well roasted, but it was noticed that somehow it had not 
	been cleaned. Cook Gaius ran a knife into its belly to see if the pig was 
	fit to eat. To his surprise, out popped the intestines and they were all 
	puffed up and hollow. It was reported that he said, <em><strong><font color="#804040">
	&quot;I have discovered something of great importance.&quot;</font></strong></em> 
	Gaius stuffed the intestines with ground venison and ground beef mixed with 
	cooked ground wheat and spices. He ties them into sections and the wiener 
	was born. </font></p>

	&quot;One piece of trivia I came across is that apparently the first person to

		sausages and wore them as a (deacon's) stole. In his left hand he held a 
		pot of mustard, and he dipped (the sausages in the mustard) and ate them 
		from morning on. And he smeared mustard on the mouths of some of those 
		who came to joke with him. Wherefore also a certain rustic, who had 
		leucoma in his two eyes, came to make fun of him. Symeon anointed his 
		eyes with mustard. The man was nearly burned to death, and Symeon said 
		to him, <em>&quot;Go wash, idiot, with vinegar and garlic, and you will be 
		healed immediately.&quot; </em>As it seemed a better thing to do, he ran 
		immediately to a doctor instead and was completely blinded. Finally, in 
		a mad rage he swore in Syriac, <em>&quot;By the God of Heaven, even if my two 
		eyes should suddenly leap (from their sockets), I will do whatever the 
		Fool told me.&quot; </em>And he washed himself as Symeon told him. 
		Immediately his eyes were healed, clear as when he was born, so that he 
		honored God. Then the Fool came upon him and said to him, <em>&quot;Behold,

	- Another legend is that the popular sausage (known as &quot;dachshund&quot; or 
	&quot;little-do<u>g</u>&quot; sausage) was created in the late 1600s by Johann 
	Georghehner, a butcher living in Coburg, Germany. It is said that he later

	- It is said that the frankfurter was developed in Frankfurt, Germany (five 
	years before Christopher Columbus set sail for the new world). In 1987, the 
	city of Frankfurt celebrated the 500th birthday of the hot dog. In the

	- The people of Vienna (Wien), Austria point to the term &quot;wiener&quot; to prove 
	their claim as the birthplace of the hot dog. It is said that the master 
	sausage maker who made the first wiener got his early training in Frankfurt, 
	Germany. He called his sausage the &quot;wiener-frankfurter.&quot; But it was 
	generally known as &quot;wienerwurst.&quot; The wiener comes from Wien (the German

    <p style="margin-right: 20px"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>1852</strong> 
	- The butcher's guild in Frankfurt, Germany introduced a spiced and smoked 
	sausage which was packed in a thin casing and they called it a &quot;frankfurter&quot; 
	after their hometown. The sausage had a slightly curved shape supposedly due 
	to the coaxing of a butcher who had a popular dachshund. The frankfurter was 
	also known as a &quot;dachshund sausage&quot; and this name came with it to America. </font></p>

    <p style="margin-right: 20px"><font face="Verdana" size="2">German

    <p style="margin-right: 20px"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>1867</strong> 
	- Charles Feltman
    </font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
	(1841-1910)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">, a German butcher, opened 
	up the first Coney Island hot dog stand in Brooklyn, New York. According to 
	the article <u>Coney Island: Food &amp; Dining</u> 
	by Jeffrey Stanton:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="margin-right: 20px"><strong style="font-weight: 400">
		<font color="#008000">In 1867 Charles Feltman owned a pie-wagon that 
		delivered his freshly baked pies to the inns and lager-beer saloons that 
		lined Coney Island's beaches. His clients also wanted hot sandwiches to 
		serve to their customers. But his wagon was small and he knew that it 
		would be hard to manage making a variety of sandwiches in a confined 
		space. He thought that perhaps something simple like a hot sausage 
		served on a roll might be the solution. He presented his problem to 
		Donovan, the wheel-wright on East New York and Howard Street in 
		Brooklyn, who had built his pie-wagon. The man saw no problem in 
		building a tin-lined chest to keep the rolls fresh and rigging a small 
		charcoal stove inside to boil sausages. <br>
      <br>
      When the wheel-wright finished the installation they fired up the stove 
		for a test run. Donovan thought that the sausage sandwich was a strange 
		idea but he was willing to try it as Feltman boiled the succulent pork 
		sausage and placed between a roll. The wheel-wright tasted the it and 
		liked it. Thus the hot-dog was born. </font></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-right: 20px">He sold 3,684 sausages in a roll during his 
	first year in business. He is also credited with the idea of the warm bun. 
	The hard-working Feltman built a mini-empire with a hotel, beer gardens, 
	restaurants, food stands, and various rides to amuse his customers. The 
	Depression in the 1930's began the decline of Feltman's business. Visitors 
	to Coney Island could barely afford the subway ride yet alone a sit down 
	meal at Feltman's. At his death in 1910, he left a business worth over one 
	million dollars which all started with selling hot dogs. </p>
    </font><p style="margin-right: 20px"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>
			1880</strong> - A German peddler, Antonoine Feuchtwanger, sold hot 
			sausages in the streets of St. Louis, Missouri. He would supply 
			white gloves with each purchase so that his customers would not burn 
			their hands while eating the sausage. He saw his profits going down 
			because the customers kept taking the gloves and walking off with 
			them. His wife suggested that he put the sausages in a split bun 
			instead. He reportedly asked his brother-in-law, a baker, for help. 
			The baker improvised long soft rolls that fit the meat, thus 
			inventing the hot dog bun. When he did that, the hot dog was born. 
			He called them <u>
			red hots</u>.</font></p>
    <p style="margin-right: 20px"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>1886</strong> 
	- H. L. Mencken (1880-1956), newspaperman, book reviewer, and political

		pseudo-sausages that millions of Americans now eat, and they leaked the 
		same flabby, puerile mustard. Their single point of difference lay in

				already popular beer. He was a colorful character himself. A 
				large man who wore loud, checkered clothing, Chris sat in a

				used the whistle to get the attention of players, for someone to

	- Sausage vendors would sell their wares outside the student dorms at major 
	eastern universities, and their carts became known as &quot;dog wagons.&quot; The name 
	was a sarcastic comment on the source and quality of the meat. This slang 
	term came from the popular belief that dog meat was used in making sausage. 
	Many university magazines, such as Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Cornell, 
	all show that the term &quot;hot dog&quot; was well know before 1900.</font></p>

    <p style="margin-right: 20px"><strong>1902</strong> - Another story is that 
	the term &quot;hog dog&quot; was coined in 1902 during a Giants baseball game at 
	the New York Polo grounds. On a cold April day, concessionaire Harry Mozley 
	Stevens (1855-1934) was losing money trying to sell ice cream and ice-cold 
	sodas. He sent his salesmen out to buy up all the dachshund sausages they 
	could find, and an equal number of rolls. In less than an hour, his vendors 
	were hawking hot dogs from portable hot water tanks while yelling, <strong><font color="#804040">
	&quot;They're red hot! Get your dachshund sausages while they're red hot!&quot; </font></strong></font>

				of the early <b>six-day bicycle</b> crowds at Madison Square Garden. I

	cartoonist, T.A. &quot;Tad&quot; Dorgan (1877-1929), a newspaper cartoonist for the 
	New York Evening Journal, was nearing his deadline and desperate for an 
	idea. Hearing the vendors, he hastily drew a cartoon of a frankfurter with a 
	tail, legs, and a head, so that it looked like a dachshund. Not sure how to 
	spell the word &quot;dachshund&quot; he simply wrote &quot;hot dog!&quot; The cartoon was a 
	sensation and the term hot dog was born. According to the <u>1996 Maine 
	Antique Digest</u>:</p>

		- It is also said that on June 3, 1903, Adolf Gehring was selling food 
		at a ball game in St. Louis, Missouri. On this particular day, Adolf had 
		a good day and sold out all his food and drinks. He went to a baker to 
		buy some bread, but they had nothing left but some long dinner rolls 
		which he bought. He then went to a butcher shop and bought all the 
		sausages and wieners that the butcher had. With a portable wood stove,

    <p style="margin-right: 20px"><strong>1916</strong> - An employee of Charles 
	Feltman, Nathan Handwerker (1892-1974)</span>, broke away from Feltman 
	in 1916 and, with his wife Ida, started Nathan's Famous, Inc., which now 
	calls itself the world's greatest hot dog purveyor. He opened his stand in 
	Coney Island near the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues and called it 
	Nathan's. Handwerker sold his hot dogs for five cents each. 	He used two spice suppliers to keep his hot dog recipe secret. 	To counteract the rumors of his cut-price hot dogs being less than 
	palatable, he offered free hot dogs to the doctors and nurses at Coney 
	Island Hospital. When questioned in later years about his love for 
	his own food (hot dogs), Nathan bragged, <strong style="font-weight: 400">
	<font color="#008000">&quot;I'll gladly wrassle anyone who's been living on

	resented the fact that the prospering Charles Feltman had raised the price 
	on his &quot;franks&quot; to a dime. They suggested to Nathan Handwerker that instead 
	of working for Feltman, that he go into competition with him, selling franks 
	for half the price. Some historians suggest that Nathan Handwerker borrowed 
	$320 from entertainers Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante to start the business.<img
