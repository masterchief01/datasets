								<p>In a bid to prove that nobody reads the T&amp;Cs of an online sale, GameStation added a new clause of their own...</p>
			</div>
		    <!-- Article Start -->
			GameStation has today revealed that it legally owns the souls of thousands of customers, thanks to a clause it secretly added to the online terms and conditions for the official GameStation website.<br />
<br />
The &quot;<i>Immortal Soul Clause</i>&quot; was added as part of an attempt to highlight how few customers read the terms and conditions of an online sale. GameStation claims that 88 percent of customers did not read the clause, which gives legal ownership of the customer's soul over to the UK-based games retailer. <br />
<br />
The remaining 12 percent of customers however did notice the clause and clicked the relevant opt-out box, netting themselves a &pound;5 GBP gift voucher in the process. <br />
<br />
GameStation executives are now assuring all customers that they are not enforcing the Immortal Soul Clause and will be contacting customers via email with a notice of nullification - phew!<br />
<br />
According to <a href="http://newslite.tv/2010/04/06/7500-shoppers-unknowingly-sold.html" target="_blank">News:Lite</a> more than 7,500 customers fell for the simple ploy and missed out on the gift voucher.<br />
<br />
The clause was added to GameStation's standard T&amp;Cs on April 1st. <br />
<br />

If I go into a shop and slip over on some water I would normally expect them to be responsible for that.

what would you sue them for? Realsing that customers don't read terms and conditions. I'd be invoking the term and offering people their souls back in exchange for a years work at the store, I mean that must be how they got the current staff to work for them isn't it.</div>

Wicked april fools lmao :D, people who opted out given £5 voucher :D.<br />
But to be honest some terms from too many places are way over the top &amp; would take hours to read through, all terms &amp; conditions could surely be slimmed down some to save customers some time, all to often it's a pile of blah blah blah, I always try to speed through checking the first line of each part &amp; if it doesn't seem relevant I skip to the next bit.</div>

					<div class="commentCopy">there needs to be a way to convey the gist of the legalese in far few words. most of the TaC that i read through simply amount to <br />
<br />
1. don't copy the software without permission<br />
2. don't use the software without a license<br />
3. we are not responsible for damages cause by this software<br />
4. we are not responsible if the software does not work as advertised<br />
5. we are not responsible to show you how to use the software<br />
6. all other unnamed risks and liabilities are assumed by you<br />
7. don't sue us<br />
<br />
throw in a bunch of clarifications of what "this software" is and what  "your stuff" is and which parties are who ("the company" etc.) and you basically have a 10 to 20 page standard TaC. some companies throw in things like agreeing to buy all support for said software from them, or put in an all sales final and nonrefundable clause, but as said by a few others, most of those tend to be unenforceable due to consumer protection laws. then there are all the trademark clauses, which are irrelevant to pretty much anyone since they are typically registered and protected already, but are put in anyway for some reason i do not understand. . . <br />
<br />
what we really need is a legal standard for summarizing legal documents. . . .</div>

Where do you go to if you actually find something you disagree with in some Terms and Conditions? lets say you want a new mobile phone contract and read the Terms and Conditions of a O2 contract, find something you disagree with, what options do you have? go to the competition? oh wait, they have terms and conditions too and they may look different because they where written by a different lawyer, but when it comes down to it they all mean the same anyway, you give up any rights you may would have and give them the right to do whatever they want. <br />
Point is simple, you have to sign the terms and conditions anyway or you can't have anything, no roof over your head, no transportation, no computer, no nothing. So what is the point of them being understandable or reading them? You know that you are signing away all your rights to start with, no need to read or understand them.</div>

					<div class="commentCopy">Normally having to check off for an additional clause should sound some alarms. It may be hard to read Legalese but at least a slight brush over should alert you when words like "immortal" and "soul" come up. It's a good lesson to teach people, don't just take things for granted. Very well done by GameStation!</div>

					<div class="commentCopy">Legally speaking, you have to give 'proper notice' of any unusual terms or conditions or exclusions in a contract. It would be normal to buy a game and be expected not to pirate it, for example. But anything else that you would not normally assume you have to draw proper attention to, either by having it in bold or in a prominent place.<br />
<br />
The same goes for example in a car park if their T&amp;C exclude liability for any injury you get whilst in the car park, that is not really normal -  yes exclude liability for theft but personal injury? If I go into a shop and slip over on some water I would normally expect them to be responsible for that. So they would need to put a proper notice by the ticket machine and/or entrance to say "NO LIABILITY WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY ON THESE PREMISES".<br />
<br />
So really, it's just a bit of fun, but doesn't mean anything at all. PC Gamer did something similar many years ago for their demo CD, saying if you wanted to use it you transferred possession of your home to them. Of course nobody read it :p</div>
