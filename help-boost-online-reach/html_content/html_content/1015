<p>You know all of those helpful kitchen-related suggestions that old-timers are so willing to share with the younger generations?  These little tips and tricks might be called “kitchen hacks” these days, but they’re still the same good old nuggets of wisdom that they always were.  As with any old wives’ tale, hack, or tip, your mileage may vary.  Some of these gems have been around for several lifetimes - and according to most grandmas, they really work.<br />
<span id="more-372"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. For cleaning smelly hands after chopping onions or garlic, just rub them on a stainless steel spoon.</strong> The steel is supposed to absorb the odor.</p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/coffee-beans.jpg" alt="coffee beans" width="230" height="350" align="left" /><strong>2. Fresh coffee beans can also absorb nasty odors from your hands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. If you happen to over-salt a pot of soup, just drop in a peeled potato.</strong> The potato will absorb the excess salt.</p>
<p><strong>4. When boiling eggs, add a pinch of salt to keep the shells from cracking.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Never put citrus fruits or tomatoes in the fridge.</strong> The low temperatures degrade the aroma and flavor of these persnickety fruits.</p>
<p><strong>6. To clean cast iron cookwear, don’t use detergents.</strong> Just scrub them with salt and a clean, dry paper towel.</p>
<p><strong>7. Will milk curdle if it is allowed to boil?</strong> It turns out that this age-old piece of wisdom isn’t true, after all.  Milk that has been boiled is perfectly safe to consume.</p>
<p><strong>8. To clean an electric kettle with calcium buildup on the heating element, boil a mixture of half white vinegar and half water, then empty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. When storing empty airtight containers, throw in a pinch of salt to keep them from getting stinky.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. If you are making gravy and accidentally burn it, just pour it into a clean pan and continue cooking it.</strong> Add sugar a little at a time, tasting as you go to avoid over-sugaring it.  The sugar will cancel out the burned taste.</p>
<p><strong>11. Burned a pot of rice?</strong> Just place a piece of white bread on top of the rice for 5-10 minutes to draw out the burned flavor.  Be careful not to scrape the burned pieces off of the bottom of the pan when serving the rice.</p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/burnt-rice.jpg" alt="burnt rice" width="350" height="220" align="middle" /></p>
<p><strong>12. Before you chop chili peppers, rub a little vegetable oil into your hands and your skin won’t absorb the spicy chili oil.</strong></p>
<p><strong>13. If you aren’t sure how fresh your eggs are, place them in about four inches of water.</strong> Eggs that stay on the bottom are fresh.  If only one end tips up, the egg is less fresh and should be used soon.  If it floats, it’s past the fresh stage.</p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/fresh-eggs.jpg" alt="fresh eggs" width="350" height="220" align="middle" /></p>
<p><strong>14. To banish ants from the kitchen, find out where they are coming in and cover the hole with petroleum jelly.</strong> Ants won’t trek through the jelly.  If they are coming under a door, draw a line on the floor with chalk.  The little bugs also won’t cross a line of chalk.</p>
<p><strong>15. Before making popcorn on the stove or in an air popper, soak the kernels in water for 10 minutes.</strong> Drain the water, then pop as normal.  The additional moisture helps the popcorn pop up quicker and fluffier with fewer “old maids.”</p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/popcorn.jpg" alt="popcorn" width="230" height="350" align="left" /><strong>16. Don’t store your bananas in a bunch or in a fruit bowl with other fruits.</strong> Separate your bananas and place each in a different location.  Bananas release gases which cause fruits (including other bananas) to ripen quickly.  Separating them will keep them fresh longer.</p>
<p><strong>17. To keep potatoes from budding in the bag, put an apple in with them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>18. If you manage to have some leftover wine at the end of the evening, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy addition to soups and sauces in the future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>19. To clean crevices and corners in vases and pitchers, fill with water and drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets.</strong> The bubbles will do the scrubbing.</p>
<p><strong>20. After boiling pasta or potatoes, cool the water and use it to water your house plants.</strong> The water contains nutrients that your plants will love.</p>
<p><strong>21. When you clean your fish tank, the water you drain can also be used to water your house plants.</strong> The nitrogen and phosphorus in fish droppings make aquarium water a great fertilizer.</p>
<p><strong>22. When defrosting meat from the freezer, pour some vinegar over it.</strong> Not only does it tenderize the meat; it will also bring down the freezing temperature of the meat and cause it to thaw quicker.</p>
<p><strong>23. The substance in onions that causes your eyes to water is located in the root cluster of the onion.</strong> Cut this part out in a cone shape, with the largest part of the cone around the exterior root section.</p>
<p><strong>24. Taking the top layer off of a onion can also reduce the amount of eye-watering misery.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/toothpaste.jpg" alt="toothpaste" width="230" height="350" align="left" /><strong>25. Toothpaste is a great silver cleaner.</strong></p>
<p><strong>26. Baking soda isn’t as effective a deodorizer for the fridge as that baking soda company would like you to believe.</strong> Activated charcoal is much better at absorbing fridge and freezer odors.</p>
<p><strong>27. Baking soda is an extremely effective cleaner, though.</strong> Use it with vinegar to deodorize drains and clean stovetops and sinks.</p>
<p><strong>28. A favorite tip of thousands of grandmas: when you nick your finger while cutting veggies, wait until the bleeding stops and paint on a layer of clear nail polish.</strong> It will keep juices out of the wound and won’t fall off into the spaghetti sauce like a bandage.</p>
<p><strong>29. The jury is still out on what to put in the bag of brown sugar to keep it from going hard: a slice of apple, a piece of bread, and a shard of a terra cotta pot have all been used.</strong></p>
<p><strong>30. Got a nasty invisible splinter from your kitchen tools?</strong> Put a piece of adhesive tape on the area and then pull it off to remove the splinter.</p>
<p><strong>31. When you burn yourself in the kitchen, just spread mustard on the affected area.</strong> Leave it for a while and it will ease the pain and prevent blistering.</p>
<p><strong>32. For aluminum pans that are looking dull, just boil some apple peels in them.</strong> This will brighten up the aluminum and make your house smell yummy.</p>
<p><strong>33. To keep cookies fresh, savvy grannies like to put some crumpled-up tissue paper in the bottom of the cookie jar.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/cookie-jar.jpg" alt="cookie jar" width="350" height="220" align="middle" /></p>
<p><strong>34. If your salt is clumping up, put a few grains of rice in with it to absorb excess moisture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>35. To clean fruit stains off of your fingers, rub them with a fresh, peeled potato.</strong> White vinegar can also do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>36. Keep iceberg lettuce fresh in the fridge by wrapping it in a clean, dry paper towel and storing lettuce and paper towel in a sealed baggie in the fridge.</strong></p>
<p><strong>37. If your loaf of bread is starting to go stale, just put a piece of fresh celery in the bag and close it back up.</strong> For some reason, this restores a fresh taste and texture to the bread.</p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/celery.jpg" alt="celery" width="350" height="220" align="middle" /></p>
<p><strong>38. Always keep an aloe vera plant in your kitchen.</strong> It’s invaluable when you scrape your arm or burn your finger.  Just break off a leaf and rub the gel from the inside on the injury.</p>
<p><strong>39. When making a soup, sauce, or casserole that ends up too fatty or greasy, drop in an ice cube.</strong> The ice will attract the fat, which you can then scoop out.</p>
<p><strong>40. To reuse cooking oil without tasting whatever was cooked in the oil previously, cook a 1/4″ piece of ginger in the oil.</strong> It will remove any remaining flavors and odors.</p>
<p><strong>41. If your milk always goes bad before you can finish it, try adding a pinch of salt to the carton when you first open it.</strong> It will stay fresh days longer.</p>
<p><strong>42. Water that has been boiled and allowed to cool will freeze faster than water from the tap.</strong> This comes in handy when you’re having a party and need ice pronto.</p>
<p><strong>43. Remove tea or coffee stains from your fine china by mixing up a paste of baking soda, lemon juice, and cream of tartar.</strong> Rub it over the stains and they’ll come off easily.</p>
<p><img src="/qimages/5/milk0.jpg" alt="milk" width="230" height="350" align="left" /><strong>44. If two drinking glasses become stuck together after stacking, it’s not impossible to unstick them.</strong> Just put ice in the inner glass and dunk the outer glass in warm water.  The warm glass will expand and the cold glass will contract, making the glasses separate easily.</p>
<p><strong>45. For splinters under the fingernail, soaking the affected finger in a bowl of milk with a piece of bread in it is said to draw out the splinter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>46. Did grandpa ever give you a drink of cola for an upset tummy?</strong> It turns out that this is actually a pretty effective remedy.  The sugar and carbonation can soothe many tummy problems - but it can also exacerbate others.</p>
<p><strong>47. Putting salty bacon on a boil is said to “draw the poison out” of boils.</strong></p>
<p><strong>48. To help old wooden drawers (without runners) open and close smoothly, rub a candle on the tracks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>49. A cotton ball soaked in white vinegar and applied to a fresh bruise will reduce the darkness of the bruise and help it disappear sooner.</strong></p>
<p><strong>50. Drinking cranberry juice and eating blueberries regularly will help stave off urinary tract infections. </strong></p>

          	      		          	<p>#31 is likewise an old wives tale, and can seriously aggravate any burns.  As a trained EMT who has seen many cases of people following such kitchen lore, I understand that these myths are popular - but for your own sake!  Slease, please do not put mustard, butter, or anything else on a wound, other than to run it under cold water if it is a burn.</p>

          	      		          	<p>just a further comment:  I enjoyed the list.  Very cute.  But a word of warning as the EMT said:  salves ointments or in this case mustard applied to a burn will actually make the injury worse because it will seal in the heat and prolong the burning process.  Additionally,  broken skin that may occur,  will obsorb mustard and whatever else is shmeared on, increasing the chance of infection.  Flushing continuously ( read as:  Longer then you think is needed!  Like 15 mins)  with cool water for superficial burns,  and dial. 911 for more serious burns!</p>

<p>@Jennifer: my grandmother always used to put butter on burns.  I still have a scar or two from those.  I told her that they hurt MORE after the butter, but she swore that it was the best treatment&#8230;</p>
<p>@Steve: the author was simply making a fun list of old wives&#8217; tales from the kitchen.  No dumbness involved, I assure you.  <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

I&#8217;m a jewelrysmith, btw, and this is a very common old wives&#8217; tale for some reason. Also, the red stuff that is sold as silver cleaner is even worse. Windex with ammonia is the best thing I know to clean (not polish or anything) silver.</p>

And if the idea of heating respectively cooling the glasses individually would work very well, the heat would swell the outer glass and tighten the grip around the inner one, therefore cancelling out the cooling effect to a certain degree. Heat does not make a material expand in just one direction, which is a commen misperception. Just putting ice in the inner glass would do it though.</p>

Kitchen Tips should be that, tips to help you with cooking and clean up.  Medical advice is best left to those who are experts in that field.  All too often people give &#8220;advice&#8221; that they &#8220;heard from my neighbour&#8217;s friend&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s hairdresser&#8221;.  Advice that is incorrect and most often harmful.</p>
<p>Mustard?  On a burn?  That&#8217;s oil, vinegar, salt, tartrazine, ground mustard seed&#8230;  Do any of those sound like they would be good things to put on damaged skin?  Would you put mustard on a cut or blister?  Would you put plant juice on an open wound?  People can end up being badly scarred by following this advice and some may end up with nasty infections and a great deal of pain, with a needlessly increased recovery time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather get the right information out there and actually help people to be smarter and make better informed choices than simply congratulate someone for getting it &#8220;almost right&#8221;.</p>

          	      		          	<p>Uh, putting an open aloe vera leaf on a burn is totally acceptable and in most cases prevents scarring, etc. It&#8217;s not like the list is recommending that you run out to the yard and grab the first green thing you see, so &#8220;plant juice&#8221; isn&#8217;t a cause for concern. Aloe is proven to be a superior agent in healing sunburns and other minor skin trauma. It suppose it should be noted we&#8217;re talking about a minor kitchen burn here, not those from a five-alarm house fire. Obviously, it takes some common sense to determine which tips from the list might be worth a try.</p>

Aloe Vera is a plant.  Plant juice = potentially full of nasty bacteria as well as a breeding ground for more bacteria once it&#8217;s spread on your skin.  (It contains sugars and water, which are a paradise for microscopic nasties).  Yes, even Aloe Vera.

Have to admit though, that this post does give a smile and is fun to read. There are a few things in this list that DO work, but I think most people have enough logic to give some other ones a second thought, like adding salt to milk to make it last longer. But there are a few that seem like its harmless enough to try, like the egg floating one. As for medical treatments for burns and such, I would still have to agree with Kate, leave it to the trained professionals. And besides, if you get burns enough that you need to raise a plant in your kitchen just for burns, why don&#8217;t you go buy some ointment. But honestly, this sounds like a fun list of things to try out, minus some of the questionable ones. Definitely trying the boiling apple peels to shine the aluminum one, seems harmless and I need a cheap air freshener <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

          	      		          	<p>I&#8217;ve gotta throw my two cents in here.  I bought mini terracotta pots (about 2 tablespoons or so) and soaked them in warm water for 20 minutes, dried them off and threw them into my brown sugar.  It&#8217;s a great trick 1) keeps it really moist and 2) it&#8217;s a little sugar scooper for when I just need a little bit!</p>
<p>And no, I would NEVER put mustard (hmm, HOT tasting thing) on a burn.  Just to reassure you EMTs out there - some of us do know better <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> you probably just always get the other ones.</p>

          	      		          	<p>I can not find ANYWHERE online, or in my medical books, where anyone says that you should NOT put aloe on 1st degree burns, which is what most people use it for. In fact, aloe has been shown to HAVE antimicrobial properties (google &#8220;Antimicrobial Activity Aloe&#8221; for references). What we do question is the efficacy of aloe once it&#8217;s been mixed with other things. In most aloe compounds you buy in the store, it is usually only the evaporation of the alcohol in the gel that gives you the cooling sensation. Really, it is BETTER to use the straight &#8220;plant juices&#8221; than something you paid too much money for.</p>
<p>If you want to rant about how something is totally unproven, and maybe harmful, why don&#8217;t you post your references too, Kate?</p>
<p>The only fault I can find with #38, is that it doesn&#8217;t say when it&#8217;s helpful to use aloe on a burn, and when it may not be. Given the cursory info given in the other 49 snippets, well&#8230;.what the heck do you want? Other comments have addressed the problems with butter/mayo/ice on burns.</p>

          	      		          	<p>Concerning the glasses stuck together - any way that you can heat the outside glass more than the inside glass or cool the inside glass more than the outside glass will make them easier to separate.  When an object is heated it expands in all directions - that is, any two points on the object get farther away from each other (like if you made several dots with marker on a deflated balloon, when you inflate the balloon each dot is getting farther away from every other dot).  So if you look at two points on opposite sides of the inside of the glass, when the glass is heated, those points will move away from each other thereby increasing the diameter of the glass (not tightening its grip on the other glass) and therefore making it easier to remove the stuck glass inside it.<br />
The trick of course is getting the outside glass to heat and expand before the inside glass. Dipping just the outside glass in boiling water (or just run it under hot water from the faucet) is a good way to heat the outside glass up slightly before the inside glass.</p>

          	      		          	<p>On 39, the best way to get rid of over greased food in my experience is to use a piece of bread. Let the sauce or soup sit for a moment without heat and a layer of grease should form, then take a piece of bread and run it over the surface to absorb most of the bad stuff. Then you can toss the bread outside as a treat for the birds, especially in the winter when they need all the fat they can get.</p>

I do recall from my first aid class that the best things for burns is to cool the burn immedately since skin will continue to burn after removed from the source of heat.<br />
Also, if you keep your house plants clean (i.e. dusting and wiping to keep off said nasty cooties) there really shouldn&#8217;t be much to be worried about.  As long as the wound is kept clean I don&#8217;t see any problems.<br />
If plant juices are so terrible why is it recommended that we eat several servings of fruits and vegetables everyday to maintain a healthy body?</p>

<p>The internals of a plant are absolutely sterile - even having ANTIMICROBIAL agents in them to kill/ward off invading biota including microbes and fungi.<br />
If they didnt, there wouldnt be any plants left on this planet at all!! - I guess you havent heard of the beneficial effects of tea tree oil, lavender oil, citrus oils in both folk and modern medicine&#8230; just naming a few!</p>
<p>That is why putting aloe vera juice (the INTERNALS) of the plant on your minor burns actually facilitates healing - all that sterile, antomicrobial goodness from inside the plant is transferred onto you.</p>
<p>If you want to debunk a well known, and extensively tested old time/modern remedy, I suggest you really get your facts straight.</p>

<p>Many of these do work.   Some are indeed old wives tales.  Not nearly as many are as claimed here though.  In fact almost none.  Boiled water does freeze faster and if the person posting actually TOOK the physics class he recommended would already have known that.

No come on, thats cute old timey grandmas magic solutions, but lets not continue tradtions that can cause an ignorant person harm. Many people are unaware of what they might be doing, so using the title &#8220;AMAZINGLY HELPFUL TIME TESTED TIPS&#8221; just may lead a reader into belief that these are safe/&#8221;helpful&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of these are ok, like a pinch a salt isnt going to hurt milk or aloe on a burn..but Mustard? WTF people seriously? this isnt the depression era or dark ages. Lets let some of these harmful traditions die along with the period they came from. I understand wanting to be thrifty and resorceful, but some times you have to just say, &#8220;oops I f*cked up the soup&#8221; or &#8220;I should clean my burn with mild soap and water and put some burn cream from the drug store&#8221; this is the ERA of information, so lets be informative and help each other out with realistic tips like, dont take advice on how to put food condiments on your wounds from grandma.  </p>
<p>if thats not enough for you, check on the web about all the dangerous crap that we use to do &#8220;back in the day&#8221;<br />
kitchen tips are cute, but like they said, lets leave the medical advice to the professionals..</p>

NEVER put mustard on a burn, if anything you should put a mustard SEED on the burn and even then a lot of people get bothered by that.</p>

          	      		          	<p>lol, reading these comments was almost as much fun as reading the article that sparked them! Kudos to Fash, Deaner, Momzilla, chris, Bojangles, and phil:) You guys are a breath of fresh air!  I enjoyed this piece, especially since I have found from PERSONAL EXPERIENCE that most of these work. I also have experimented enough in my life that I know that some of the tips don&#8217;t work. And some new ones that look fun to try! I surf the web a lot, so know to take stuff &#8220;with a grain of salt&#8221;, as my granny used to say:)But one thing that never ceases to amaze me is when people strain so hard to find fault with others&#8230; and get all steamed if someone disagrees with them. Why bother?! If you have something worthwhile to say, it would certainly be advisable to research what you base your opinion on, then the rest of us wouldn&#8217;t wish you&#8217;d just shut up.</p>

          	      		          	<p>Because one cannot scientifically prove a method that natural substances can cure does not make the cure incorrect or dangerous. I am of the medical field and know, just as well as you do, Kate, that the &#8220;medical expert&#8221; methods of healing the human body often times fail. Does that make them dangerous? Maybe it does. Many times we &#8220;treat&#8221; cancer with totally toxic substances, knowing it will destroy even healthy parts of the being we&#8217;re trying to cure and know that it most likely will not pardon the life within the body we&#8217;re treating, however we do it anyway. Please don&#8217;t use your &#8220;smarter than thou&#8221; attitude to make those you feel are inferior look ingnorant. At best you are making a few weak pojts and making youself look really incompassionate and narrow-minded. And, do not try to insinuate that you have never used a home remedy for your own first aid needs, because you havbe. Everyone has and you will in the future. Contrary to your belief that only medical experts should be able to care for the human body, average people who have taken the wisdom of the one&#8217;s before them can and will forever more use simple, natural, everyday items that are at our quick disposal to treat minor irritations and ailments. What&#8217;s the harm in that? Nothing.</p>

I think people worry about germs too much.  Or maybe it&#8217;s just worried people worry too much about germs. And while rubber gloves would be a very sensible, but tedious way of avoiding chili oil, I think a light film of oil is not going to make using a knife appreciably more dangerous than without oil.  The ice thing:  It&#8217;s not that the ice &#8220;attracts&#8221; the oil, its that the oil in proximity to the ice congeals making it easy to remove.</p>

Iv tried most of these<br />
46 is true<br />

It also depends on the person.<br />

<p>After reading these comments I think I would be afraid to publish anything online for fear of being assaulted by a bunch of prats who think they know better.  If your life is so bad that you need to login online and bash other people to raise your self esteem then you need a life.  you are a bunch of bully&#8217;s.  </p>
<p>also, STOP being so scared!  we are not made of glass! put mustard on your cuts, kate, eat a raw vegetable, they are good for you and not so dangerous, and if it DEFIES physics try it anyway, because the beauty of science is that it always changes, and if it doesn&#8217;t work then just  don&#8217;t do it again&#8230;. Its not the end of the world.  We need to live in a world where we are responsible for ourselves, because we are all capable of doing so.   People like you kate are turning this world into a bunch of fat wusses.  And if you are so scared of everything then go live in a padded bubble.</p>

It&#8217;s a shoddy article with bad advice mixed in with the good, and some of that bad advice is dangerously bad.  Not life-threatening, but major cuts and infections bad.  Better to have less content than content that is of negative value.</p>
<p>Since the author didn&#8217;t bother to check any of these (i.e. toothpaste is a good silver cleaner) or think very hard about them (i.e. put oil on your hands while using a knife) I think people are right to treat the whole list with some hostility.</p>

          	      		          	<p>The boiling water tip is known as mpemba effect, it only works if you put still boiling water into a fridge that has around 0°C. Basically the boiling water has much time to evaporate into the air at 0°C thus leaving less water to freeze. As you may guess less water means less time till frozen <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
In the end you&#8217;re better off putting less water into the fridge from the beginning. You a) won&#8217;t have to cook thee water and b) your fridge won&#8217;t look like a glacier afterwards.  </p>
<p>This won&#8217;t work at all at typical fridge temperatures since the water will cool down too fast thus leaving more liquid and less evaporated water.</p>
<p>Putting mustard/oil/flour on a wound isn&#8217;t good at all. In best case it will simply hurt, in worst case you get yourself a nice little infection. Ice or water are better. </p>
<p>If you want to put aloe an your cuts do as you like, I prefer some zinc paste or medical alcohol (depending of the wound either onto the cut or into the head ;))</p>
<p>Nail polish for cuts? I use liquid bandages but if you like that burning sensation&#8230; <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>While in general you would be right about &#8220;plant juice&#8221;, you&#8217;re wrong about Aloe. Overall, it&#8217;s not beneficial or harmful to put on your skin. However, it does have natural antibiotic and antifungal properties against very particular strains including Streptococcus. It is NOT &#8220;full of bacteria&#8221; as you claim. However, the overall affect isn&#8217;t beneficial.</p>

Boiling DISTILLED water and then freezing prevents the ice from getting cloudy and having bubbles in it, but it does not make it freeze faster.</p>

 Well Steve, you should go take Physics class as you are 100% wrong. Boiling the water forces the dissolved gases out of solution, the end result is that the water is then easier to freeze. I have repaired frozen pipes in dozens of houses, in all but one case it was only the hot water lines that froze!</p>

          	      		          	<p>wow - lots and lots of replies.  lol  My mother-in-law burned her hand at Christmas (minor burn - no blisters but very red) and immediately put toothpaste on it, just the regular paste kind. I thought she was nuts.  30 minutes later, there was no sign of redness and the burn was gone.  WTF???  I still thought she was nuts.  Not long after that, I burned my hand, right on the nuckle making pudding.  I licked the boiling pudding off my knuckle and saw a bright red spot (minor with no blisters).  I decided to try the toothpaste business and holy sh*t - it worked.  Was irritating to keep something on my knuckle while I finished up in the kitchen, but seriously, it worked great.  It does NOT work if you have blisters, just for a very minor burn.  My nephew can vouch for that.  He burned both hands (2nd degree burns and lots of blisters) on the stove and the toothpaste only made it worse.  Blisters + toothpaste = a bad time.  You have to use your best judgement people.  But really, on minor burns - next time you get a little scald, go out on a limb, get out of your padded bubble and try something new, like toothpaste or mustard, you might find it works. so&#8230; w/e  it was fun reading all these silly remarks.  <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

          	      		          	<p>I have used aloe plant leaves on sunburn for ages and it is fantastic. I haven&#8217;t used it on anything worse - but for sunburn, it&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p>I have used a cut/peeled potato in a sauce that was oversalted and it brought the sauce back to edible. I also tried it in macaroni salad a while back (mayonaise based) and believe it or not, it made a huge difference as well. Went from a salad that was going to get tossed to one that we enjoyed for dinner.</p>
<p>I have rubbed my onion/garlic scented hands on whatever stainless steel piece is nearby when washing up after cutting them up and my hands are scent free. I have proven this by not doing that and regretting it later when all I smelled was the onion/garlic when my hands were near my face. A trip to the sink and a stainless piece of cutlery work every time.</p>
<p>Brown sugar? A resealable bag works great.</p>

          	      		          	<p>Kitchen Burns: A tip I got from a student years ago and REALLY works amazingly well:  If you get a kitchen burn immediately drench in cold water: dry carefully and coat burn with your Washing Up Liquid.  No pain. No blister.  A miracle.  Everyone has it next to the sink!  Definately better than expensive Burn Eze spray which I found was really painful and useless - and often hard to find!  No idea how it works but it does EVERY TIME! <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

It all depends on the area in which you live!<br />
Boiling water takes away many of the impurities, and its these that slow down the speed in which water freezes!<br />
Boiled water will also be more clear when frozen, giving you a better ice cube.</p>

<p>REAL ginger ale or ginger tea will work as well, most commonly found ginger ale (like canada dry, etc) does not contain ginger, just flavoring, so it won&#8217;t work.</p>

When I was undergoing radiation therapy for cancer, the radiologists were adamant that the only thing I was allowed to apply to the area being irradiated was pure aloe gel. After so many sessions, your skin gets burned and that&#8217;s what I was told to use by mymedical professional.</p>

Second, so does the toothpaste thing&#8230;but you have to use it like a polish, let it sit for a bit and then gently remove, then buff.</p>
<p>Also, I prefer super glue over nail polish.</p>
<p>A couple of more tips: if your food is too spicy, add some lime juice. And when cooking with milk, the best way to clean your dishes afterwards is to rinse with cold water first.</p>

Regarding health care professionals/experts&#8230; they aren&#8217;t actually experts. They are &#8220;practicing!&#8221; When I was a kid, my mom fought to keep my tonsils; now it&#8217;s not recommended to remove them except in extreme cases. Shock therapy has gone by the wayside as well as bloodletting and labotomies&#8230; but all were originally performed with the help of your &#8220;medical expert!&#8221; If you really want to see what blind trust can get you, take a gander at the Tuskeegee Syphilis Experiment.<br />
As for me, I&#8217;m prett confident that I can diagnose and treat a minor malady without &#8220;expert&#8221; assistance. Cancer? I&#8217;ll see a doctor. Severed limb? Doctor. Deep cut, not spurting? Debatable. Kitchen burn? Seriously&#8230; if I have to run to the doctor for that, I might as well move in and save the gas <img src='http://lifehackery.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

Yes, not all of them work and some have actually caused more harm than good. On the other hand, science is discovering all the time what indigenous peoples have known for years. Bush medicines are not only effective but many of them are what our own &#8220;scientific&#8221; remedies are based on. Ever hear of willow bark tea? Natural aspirin. Or how about the leaves that are used to make cocaine that native peoples use to help them in high altitudes? Just because something is old and your grandmother used to do it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s wrong.</p>

          	      		          	<p>Vinegar as tenderizer - this is not a myth.  The acidity in the vinegar weakens and breaks some of the hydrogen bonds in the collagen proteins and cause them to relax.  Collagen is the key protein that can cause meat to be tough. Obviously proteolytic enzymes can do a faster and more effective  job of breaking down proteins, but, unfortunately it also breaks down other proteins in the meat and can cause loss of flavour and texture, especially if the enzymatic reaction is left to proceed fro too long.</p>

          	      		          	<p>The tip about adding an apple to potatoes to avoid sprouting is completely false!!!  It will achieve in fact the opposite!</p>
<p>Apples releases high amounts of a gas substance called ethylene when ripening.  Ethylene accelerates the ripening process (also of other fruit in the vicinity).  Several scientific articles have shown that ethylene will hasten the sprouting of stored potatoes.  see: Effect of exposure time of ethylene on potato sprout development<br />

          	      		          	<p>re: 42 Hot water takes longer to freeze. (A simple energy transfer formula from physics can show this) Assuming the water was boiled and then allowed to cool to the same temperature as the non-boiled water, it might freeze a tiny bit faster or seem to because boiled water has less dissolved gasses in it.  This is why some ice is completely clear, while other ice seems to have a lot of bubbles in it.  As water temperature drops the ability to dissolve gas in it drops to and bubbles are forced out, fogging the ice.  This may account for the perception that boiled water froze faster.  It certainly makes ice that is clearer and may be more attractive. Boiling water and allowing it to cool in a sealed jar will form a vacuum and further remove dissolved gasses.  The more gas removed the clearer the ice.</p>

#42 my friend does this all the time, putting hot water in the cube trays.   the obvious reason is because the heat causes the freezer to kick on faster. There are a few it depends here, but if your freezer has a blower this is forced convection, getting the blower to turn on definitely will freeze it faster. </p>
<p>Instead (better, and greener for the environment and better for your electric bill) try turning down the freezer temperature to kick the freezer on, (if a duel fridge freezer control set the freezer to have more of the cold mix too) also use water that was in your fridge as another shortcut with this method.     also make sure the ice cube trays are where the freezer vent blows on them.   we all know how in the winter blowing cold air (wind chill) cools you more than stagnant air.</p>

Yes, it takes common sense to know that this is stuff that is to be taken with a grain of salt&#8230; use it if you like. I have not seen one PHYSICIAN actually comment on here. Anyone care to know why? They don&#8217;t have time for this sort of triviality. As for Kate, if you want to save people, get a M.D. degree and go do it, but quit espousing your drivel just to make yourself feel superior.  There are things that it is helpful to point out are not perhaps in the best interest of a patient who needs serious care. CLEARLY&#8230; wow I am glad you had to call people names just to clear that up. As for people saying that the best course is to run to the doctor at every moment and then saying that an eventual doctor trip if the condition worsens cause economic stress for the taxpayer&#8230; please think before you say things like that.

          	      		          	<p>#42 - Boiled water freezes faster than &#8216;normal&#8217; water - has drawn a lot of comments.<br />
This effect does really exist and is called the Mpemba effect and works not only for mere boiled water but even for heated water that starts the freezing process at a higher temperature than the comparison water. Amazing, isn&#8217;t it!<br />
Re-discovered by a NZ school boy and waved off for a while by the scientific community because it seems contradictory to physics laws. It was then investigate more and recognized. Multiple trials of explanation have been done, read more at (hope the links are allowed, if not, search for Mpemba on Google):<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect</a> OR<br />

So, to everyone who wrote that this was nonsense, keep an open mind next time, not everything is what it seems at first sight.</p>

          	      		          	<p>Goodness, I&#8217;m surprised at all the poor spellers out there in the world. </p>
<p>First off, I suggest to all the people who talk about mustard not working/helping a burn: Go burn your hand on a BBQ or grab a metal pan that has been in the oven for 30+ minutes. Sure, an OTC item will work but if little Billy is screaming, grab the mustard and squirt it on the burn. Pretty soon he&#8217;ll tell you it feels all better. DO NOT wash it off, the heat returns slowly but surely. Allow the mustard to dry on the skin (Yeah, it&#8217;s messy but just do it), when it flakes off, the burn will be gone. </p>
<p>Aloe vera works and you can even make a tea from the &#8220;leaves&#8221; and drink it for &#8220;what ails you.&#8221; </p>
<p>Drop an ice cube into hot grease-covered food and the oil/grease will harden when coming in contact with the ice (it&#8217;s like putting the pot of soup or what ever you have in the refrigerator overnight). Works like a charm.</p>
<p>BTW, if you re-read Kate&#8217;s last post, she left the site right after that post (or maybe she&#8217;s lurking) so ranting on her is useless.</p>
<p>I, for one, liked the helpful hints and will copy onto a file for future reference to have on hand. The comments portion is hysterical. I stumbled upon this and will stumble off to somewhere else and check out the comments section. What fun.</p>

<p>One of the things that causes freezer burn is temperature fluctuations in the freezer. To avoid freezer burn, you want to keep the temperature in the freezer as constant as possible.</p>
<p>Putting an ice cube tray of hot water into the freezer will cause the exact kind of temp fluctuation that contributes to freezer burn. </p>
<p>So you have to ask yourself; is throwing out meat that should otherwise still be good a price you&#8217;re willing to pay to get your ice cubes 5 minutes sooner?</p>
