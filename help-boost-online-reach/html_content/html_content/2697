                    	<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" --><p align="justify">Insufficient level of HGH in the body can lead to retarded growth among children. However, this is not the only reason for the availability of HGH supplements and products in the market. You may be recommended to use these products if you are an athlete, bodybuilder or one worried about the progressing age. As you start researching, you may come across many forms of HGH products. It is better if you begin your search after learning about the top 5 forms in which these products can be found.</p>
                    	<h3 align="justify">HGH Pills</h3>
                    	<p align="center"><img src="images/HGH-pills.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="263" /></p>
                    	<p align="justify">                    	  When looking for HGH supplements, you will find a number of brands offering them in the form of pills. The most significant aspect of these products is that they are available at cheap prices. Moreover, they offer desired results by easily circulating the growth hormone across the body. However, the results they offer may not appear as fast as those produced by other HGH products. </p>
                    	<h3 align="justify">HGH Powders</h3>
                    	<p align="center"><img src="images/HGH-powder.jpg" alt="" width="311" height="321" /></p>
                    	<p align="justify">                    	  HGH supplements available in the powder form are not only inexpensive, but easy to administer as well. You can mix the powder in water or juice as per the recommendations. Just like HGH pills, these powders may not show instant results. Remember that these supplements contain vitamins, minerals and amino acids in conjunction with herbs to show improved results.</p>
                    	<h3 align="justify">HGH Sprays</h3>
                    	<p align="center"><img src="images/HGH-spray.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="381" /></p>
                    	<p align="justify">                    	  Relatively newer HGH products, these sprays became popular instantly with their launch in the market. These sprays are prepared by diluting the human growth hormone with water. The main advantage of these sprays is that they are readily absorbed by the bloodstream and take lesser time than HGH pills and powders to deliver desirable results. At the same time, these products have been proved to be safe for oral administration. Going further, these products are relatively cheaper than many other forms of HGH supplements.</p>
                    	<h3 align="justify">HGH Injections</h3>
                    	<p align="center"><img src="images/HGH-injection.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="368" /></p>
                    	<p align="justify">                    	  Another popular way of administrating HGH is in the injection form. In fact, these injections were the first category of HGH products launched in the market. However, some users find the procedure of using injections painful. Moreover, it is strictly recommended to get them administered by experts only. This means that you can’t use them of your own at home. At the same time, the fact that HGH is instantly introduced to the bloodstream with injections can’t be ignored. You must also consider the fact that HGH injections are the most expensive among the HGH products. </p>
                    	<h3 align="justify">Homeopathic HGH</h3>
                    	<p align="center"><img src="images/Homeopathic-HGH.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="298" /></p>
                    	<p align="justify">                    	  Homeopathy has emerged as a popular science and no wonder that homeopathic HGH products can be easily found available at the health stores. These products are prepared using a small dose of the human growth hormone with a base solution. Homeopathically prepared HGH products are extremely safe and are usually recommended for different individuals. Moreover, they are easy to administer and available at low price tags. </p>
                    	<p align="justify">In order to choose the best among the HGH products, you should consult one or more health experts. Evaluating these products on the basis of speeds of result, longevity of results, ingredients and probable side-effects should also help you.</p>
