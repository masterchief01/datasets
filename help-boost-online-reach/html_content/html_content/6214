Let&#8217;s say I was an alien, or new here or something &#8212; er, not entirely impossible, if you consider that I woke up yesterday with small feet fidgeting way further up my rib cage than I thought anatomically possible, leading me to wonder what I actually know about anatomy, leading to an inadvisable, rash amount of Google Image searching, leading to my eyes popping out of my head and whoa, I&#8217;ve digressed mightily &#8212; and I asked you to explain to me what is this &#8220;graham cracker&#8221; flavor that you speak of, could you do it?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3574052496/" title="dark brown sugar"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2460/3574052496_58c0bc7eca_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="dark brown sugar" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3574054690/" title="butter, cubed"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2432/3574054690_bc36f7e55d_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="butter, cubed" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3574056872/" title="honey"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3629/3574056872_6ddc23569d_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="honey" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3573252305/" title="graham cracker dough"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3656/3573252305_ae0c747174_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="graham cracker dough" /></a></p>
<p>Because I&#8217;ve spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure out what it was, and seeing the wide range of graham cracker &#8212; they&#8217;re something like digestive biscuits, for those of you across the pond &#8212; recipes out there, it&#8217;s not just me. There was the one I tried a couple years ago with rye flour, which I can assure you, was not the answer. <a href="http://www.hodgsonmill.com/tips-tricks-terms/index.php?page=what-is-graham-flour">Graham flour</a> &#8212; a coarsely, exactingly ground whole wheat flour &#8212; would be the obvious answer, since they originate with one Rev. Sylvester Graham himself, but that doesn&#8217;t go far to explain the curious flavor of the cookie-like crackers. Cinnamon is another thing most recipes agree on, but when I tried a version with a lot of cinnamon <i>in it</i> (rather than on it, in a cinnamon-sugar coating), it tasted wrong. Ditto with another that contained an excess of molasses.</p>

<p>Anyway, I stopped searching the first time I made Nancy Silverton&#8217;s graham crackers. She&#8217;s figured it out so everyone else can stop trying. Her combination of dark brown sugar (which I know is molasses-heavy but somehow less aggressive than straight molasses-sweetened versions), honey and a large amount of vanilla makes perfect, better-than-store-bought graham crackers. Well, better than better-than-store-bought, namely because graham crackers as we&#8217;ve come to known them are rather bland and forgettable, and these are too good for a cheesecake crust. I&#8217;d say possibly too good to share with your kid, too, but seeing as I am currently at the mercy of one&#8217;s aforementioned limbs and wish in no way to draw their ire, I will promise to share. For now.</p>

<p><b>Graham Crackers</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375501932?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0375501932">Nancy Silverton&#8217;s Pastries from the La Brea Bakery</a>, and <a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/000126.html">101 Cookbooks</a>, because for some absurd reason that will be immediately rectified, this book is not yet in my collection.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to graham crackers, do know that the word &#8220;cracker&#8221; is misleading. They&#8217;re moderately sweet, like a cookie or biscuit, but they do have the snap of a cracker. I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;d serve them with cheese, but if you&#8217;ve never schmeared them with cream cheese frosting, you&#8217;re missing out.</p>
<p>The topping amount will make a heavy coating, like the store-bought ones. Make only half if you just want a light-to-moderate sprinkling.</p>
<p>Makes 10 4 x 4.5-inch graham crackers or 48 2-inch squares</p>
<p>2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (375 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour (a swap of 1/2 cup with whole wheat flour or 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour works well here, too)<br />
1 cup (176 grams) dark brown sugar, lightly packed<br />
1 teaspoon (6 grams) baking soda<br />
3/4 teaspoon kosher or coarse sea salt  (4 grams)<br />
7 tablespoons (3 1/2 ounces or 100 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes and frozen<br />
1/3 cup  (114 grams) mild-flavored honey, such as clover<br />
5 tablespoons (77 grams) milk, full-fat is best<br />
2 tablespoons (27 grams) pure vanilla extract</p>
<p><u>Topping</u> (optional)<br />
3 tablespoons  (43 grams) granulated sugar<br />
1 teaspoon  (5 grams) ground cinnamon</p>
<p><u>Make the dough:</u> Combine the flour, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Pulse or mix on low to incorporate. Add the butter and pulse on and off on and off, or mix on low, until the mixture is the consistency of a coarse meal.</p>
<p>[Alternately, if you don't have a food processor or electric mixer, you can cut the ingredients together with a pastry blender. Just make sure they're very well incorporated.]</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, milk, and vanilla extract. Add to the flour mixture and pulse on and off a few times or mix on low until the dough barely comes together. It will be very soft and sticky. Lay out a large piece of plastic wrap and dust it lightly with flour, then turn the dough out onto it and pat it into a rectangle about 1-inch thick. Wrap it, then chill it until firm, about 2 hours or overnight. Meanwhile, prepare the topping, if using, by combining the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and setting aside.</p>
<p><u>Roll out the crackers:</u> Divide the dough in half and return one half to the refrigerator. Sift an even layer of flour onto the work surface and roll the dough into a long rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. The dough will be sticky, so flour as necessary. Trim the edges of the rectangle to 4 inches wide. Working with the shorter side of the rectangle parallel to the work surface, cut the strip every 4 1/2 inches to make 4 crackers. [This makes a traditional graham cracker shape. I rebelled and made mine into 2-inch fluted squares with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0NKOA?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B001M0NKOA">one of these</a>.]</p>
<p>Place the crackers on one or two parchment-lined baking sheets and sprinkle with the topping. Chill until firm, about 30 to 45 minutes in the fridge or 15 to 20 minutes in the freezer. Repeat with the second batch of dough. Finally, gather any scraps together into a ball, chill until firm, and re-roll.</p>
<p>Adjust the oven rack to the upper and lower positions and preheat the oven to 350&#176;F. </p>
<p><u>Decorate the crackers:</u> Mark a vertical line down the middle of each cracker, being careful not to cut through the dough (again, this is for the traditional cracker shape). Using a toothpick or skewer (I like to use the blunt end of a wooden skewer for more dramatic dots), prick the dough to form two dotted rows about 1/2 inch for each side of the dividing line.</p>
<p>Bake for 15 to 25 minutes, until browned and slightly firm to the touch, rotating the sheets halfway through to ensure even baking. [The baking time range is long because the original recipe calls for 25 minutes but my new oven -- which I suspect runs crazy hot but have yet to confirm with the actual purchase of an oven thermometer -- had them done in way less. Be safe, check them sooner. Nobody likes a burnt cracker!]</p>

				<p>Mmmm, I&#8217;ve always wanted to try graham crackers, thanks!  I was wondering if you think it would be workable if I used shortening instead of butter as I am currently breastfeeding and my little guy has a pretty bad sensitivity to diary.  (Love means willingly giving up what used to comprise of 90% of what you put in your mouth!)  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Deb, if it weren&#8217;t for the fact I&#8217;m making your Hostess Cake tomorrow for a friend&#8217;s graduation party, I would be making these instead.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever tried them with marscapone cheese? I love the velvety softness of the cheese which just makes the sweetness of the cookie/cracker stand out that much more&#8230;</p>

				<p>One of my favorite snacks while living in Greece were these cinnamon flavored crackers topped with a layer of dark chocolate, and I&#8217;m thinking this would produce a really similar flavor.  I&#8217;ve often wondered about recreating them at home, so I&#8217;m going to give it a shot.<br />
These photos are absolutely gorgeous!</p>

				<p>My little girl LOVED to lodge her foot in my rib cage. I&#8217;d have to slowly massage it down when it started to pinch and got hard to breathe.</p>
<p>Now that she&#8217;s 4 months and loves to throw her feet/legs up in the air, I think back to how it all makes sense :)</p>
<p>Enjoy it&#8230;I miss being pregnant~ :)</p>

				<p>Can&#8217;t get my favorite honeymaid grahams here in London so I&#8217;m so glad you posted this, especially because I&#8217;ve been desperately craving smores. Now onto the other problem&#8230;Londoners sell their marshmallows in packs where many of them are pink and strawberry or peach flavored&#8230;</p>

				<p>Hey Deb, it just occurred to me: I was never, ever the type to buy kitchen tools I didn&#8217;t really, really need&#8230; until I started reading Smitten Kitchen.  In the past few months I seem to have collected a tart pan, mini loaf pans, a pastry blender (none of which I have used, mind you)&#8230; and now I&#8217;m itching to get my hands on a pastry wheel so the graham crackers I (don&#8217;t) make will look as beautiful as yours.  Thanks for being so inspiring, even if not exactly good for my kitchen-tool-budget.</p>

				<p>I never thought about how bland the store bought ones are, but you&#8217;re right &#8211; they&#8217;re pretty tasteless.  I bet these taste wonderful.  And I bet they&#8217;d make an amazing cheesecake crust!</p>

				<p>Buying graham crackers at the store is stressful. The &#8220;good tasting&#8221; kind has hydrogenated fat and corn syrup in them. The healthy kind are &#8220;bad tasting&#8221; much like chewing a piece of cardboard. Because of that, our house has been devoid of them, much to the dismay of my 5 year old. Now I have a great solution! Thanks!</p>

				<p>Deb, these look so delicious (and I would definitely make a double batch to use for cheesecake crust)!  Do you think these could be made with another kind of flour?  Maybe soy or nut flour?

				<p>How fascinating &#8211; I had always wondered what graham crackers really were. Being English it was all very confusing when I started looking at American recipes, especially for cheesecake, and having these funny cracker things involved. These look lovely, will have to make some and see what the fuss is all about.</p>

				<p>Flour substitutions: I&#8217;ve mentioned the ones I&#8217;ve tried successfully in the recipe. Anything else, please try at home and report back to us. I am sure others will appreciate your experiments!</p>
<p>KatieK &#8212; Thinner and darker-baked ones were very crunchy, the rest were moderately crunchy. You can bake them less if you want them softer. After being in an air-tight container overnight, they&#8217;re slightly softer but still maintain their crunch.</p>

				<p>this is amazing &#8211; my triplets are addicted to graham crackers, but i&#8217;m trying to keep them away from HFCS, which all store-bought versions i&#8217;ve seen have. so i was just telling a friend that we need to find a recipe. like, last night i was telling her this. amazing!</p>
<p>the problem is, i have triplets and thus no time to actually bake them. but that&#8217;s my own conundrum to deal with.</p>

				<p>Sacha &#8211; I think soy flour has a really distinct NON-grainy taste that probably wouldn&#8217;t be very pleasing in a faux GF graham cracker, and that nut flours probably have the wrong texture and oiliness to get the right kind of crispiness too. I think a combination of rice flours (1/3 white, 1/3 brown, 1/3 sweet), quinoa flour, or sorghum flour would probably make much better substitutes in terms of comperable taste and texture. (sorghum is my least favorite though, it has an almost gummy texture sometimes!).</p>

				<p>Yum! A while back I needed vegan graham crackers for a vegan cheesecake I was making for some friends. Turns out they don&#8217;t exist, not readily at least, because most have honey in them. I ended up making <a href="http://vegancupcakes.wordpress.com/2007/07/04/graham-crackers/" rel="nofollow">this recipe</a> and was quite impressed with how well they turned out. I was also surprised at how easy it was to make them. I&#8217;ll have to try your non-vegan version sometime &#8212; they look delicious!</p>

				<p>Molly&#8230;honey is only contraindicated for infants under 1 year of age. Adults, including pregnant women and older children, can handle the botulism spores that may be present in honey because they have more mature bacteria in their intestines.</p>

				<p>Hey Deb!<br />
Gotta say am always amazed by all your baking.<br />
And your a real timesaver for me.<br />
Instead of going at it myself am all pleased sitting here watching your aamazing creations.<br />
I&#8217;ve tried to work out my own &#8220;dough-masterpieces&#8221; but ended up with a shattered heart when masterpieces turned to pieces falling through the grill. </p>
<p>Anyways, now am gonna &#8220;masterpiece away&#8221; with your oatmeal raisin cookies.<br />
Shame on the one who loses hop, right! =D</p>

				<p>I went on a graham cracker recipe hunt about 6 months ago and came up with&#8230; zilch. They all sounded icky. But this, this I can work with! </p>
<p>I grew up sitting on a stool at the kitchen counter after school, talking with my mom, smearing my graham crackers with straight up cream cheese. I thought they tasted pretty darn good :) </p>

				<p>As if your (future?) child won&#8217;t already love you heart and soul..give them a homemade (and even, gasp, store bought) cookie, and you are instantly elevated to their most beloved, forever!   If more men understood this, they too could be a bigger hero in their kids eyes!   But, oh well, a toss in the air, way up high, works too, and only &#8220;he&#8221;did that!  We&#8217;re even.  </p>
<p>I just pulled some Molasses Crinkles out of the oven after two days of begging by my 24 yo daughter (who swears I make them better) and am, for the moment, back up on the pedestal.  Oh, the power of a cookie!  (short lived as it may be)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been making the recipe for homemade graham crackers from food network for a couple years now. They are the best. I can&#8217;t buy the crap at the store anymore. Now it is time to compare the two. This one has fewer ingredients. One thing I do different is using turbindo or sanding sugar on top with the cinnamon- it makes them even prettier.</p>

				<p>We have that La Brea cookbook, and haven&#8217;t tried all our bookmarked recipes yet because we got a little fixated on the brownies and crotin de chocolat (drool).  This was one of the &#8220;try soon&#8221; recipes, but then our town got a Trader Joe&#8217;s and my sister clued me into their graham crackers (no HFCS and they don&#8217;t taste like cardboard!).  TJ&#8217;s grahams are yummy, but the store is a 20 minute drive from here.  I&#8217;d rather heat up the kitchen than drive that far for groceries, so maybe it&#8217;s time to finally try these.  I even have a pastry wheel somewhere!</p>

				<p>To Molly (#21):  There is no problem with eating honey during pregnancy.  Infants should not be fed honey, but there is absolutely no reason a pregnant woman can&#8217;t eat it.  Our adult digestive systems kill any bacteria that would be a problem for the unborn babies.  Just thought you&#8217;d like to know.</p>

				<p>Wow, here I have been eating HoneyMaid all week (comfort food, bad work week) and it just hasn&#8217;t hit the spot even with the Dove chocolate I coated a few with.  Why is it that things just don&#8217;t taste the same as when we were growing up?  Since the boys are camping I just found my project for this weekend.  Cream cheese frosting in the middle with chocolate on top too much? Grownup smores.  I&#8217;ll try the cinnamon topped ones first.  Nothing wrong with just basic with a cold glass of milk.  Thank you Deb.  And to repeat from above:  Nilla wafers next?  Isn&#8217;t it great to feel all those changes you are going through?</p>

<p>I lived in the US for almost 5 years and became addicted to these crackers.  I couldn&#8217;t get my hands on them easily back here in Australia.  All the recipes I searched included Graham flour.  Not something I can get easily, either.</p>
<p>I miss my occasional s&#8217;mores extravagance, and these crackers even just plain.  But now I can indulge again!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve tried homemade graham crackers twice, and both times were disappointing. They looked so pretty and tasted OK, but the texture was all wrong. Crumbled into pieces at the slightest touch. Growing up my mom always packed little graham cracker and frosting &#8220;sandwiches&#8221; in our lunches. By lunch time the grahams were a tiny bit soggy and the whole thing was more like a mini cake. Sooo good.<br />
Can&#8217;t wait to give these a go!</p>

				<p>D.,<br />
What are the chances?  I ran out of store bought graham crackers, and so of course my 3y old wants them.  He candidly suggested I make some.  I loved the idea, mainly because I would be doing without the added preservatives and other junk from the store boughts, and of course the challenge, but I didn&#8217;t have a recipe until today! I am so excited! You&#8217;re the best!</p>

				<p>Yum, I&#8217;m so glad you posted this as I&#8217;m planning to make them this week to prepare for a cookout. Homemade graham crackers and marshmallows for s&#8217;mores, because I am a glutton for both sugar and punishment. :) Small feet in the ribcage.. I cannot fathom. Hope you&#8217;re feeling great.</p>

				<p>Monica, there is a vegan margarine that you can use instead of shortening.  It even comes in sticks which work better for baking.  My grandson also had a sensitivity to dairy even through the breast milk too.  He eventually outgrew it, but is allergic to eggs at 3 years old.  I think that the brand that I used was Earth Balance.</p>
<p>I&#8221;ll have to try these too (sigh.)</p>

				<p>Kelly and others with chilling questions: If you have any hope of the crackers retaining their shape, the chilling process is essential. Which reminds me, I need to add a note that I actually did it for half the time in the freezer (once rolled out). They can&#8217;t be too firmed up before you put them in the oven.</p>

				<p>Gretta &#8212; You are of course <i>welcome</i> to grind them up for a crust, but you know, it might seem like a lot of extra work. I have a Key Lime Tart recipe <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/09/in-praise-of-the-pocket-sized/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, would be great with a graham crust.</p>

What&#8217;s really fun, though, is seeing them make a movement after they&#8217;re born and realizing &#8220;THAT&#8217;S what you were doing when you were inside me!&#8221;</p>

				<p>Graham crackers are one of those gluteny foods I never thought I&#8217;d miss. I never liked them much before (always my least favorite snack in kindergarten!), but since going gluten-free, it&#8217;s one of those surprising foods that seem to be everywhere all the time. (You know&#8230;except for in my mouth&#8230;) And now I can&#8217;t help but wanting some. </p>
<p>I never wanted to waste time making them because all the recipes looked bad, but yours look so beautiful, and you sound so enthusiastic, I feel like if I ever do make them myself, it will absolutely be with this recipe! Thanks!</p>

				<p>Hi, I found a s&#8217;mores brownies recipe (<a href="http://thecrepesofwrath.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/smores-brownies/#more-751" rel="nofollow">http://thecrepesofwrath.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/smores-brownies/#more-751</a>) lately which uses graham crackers. I have no clue what s&#8217;mores are, neither do I know graham crackers (I am from Germany), but the pictures looked great and the recipe sounded yummy. Anyway, I was asking the author for a graham cracker substitution and she gave me some really good hints, but now that I&#8217;ve read your recipe I can actually make the graham crackers I need for the s&#8217;mores. This is so cool! Thanks a lot for posting it!</p>

				<p>I love you. Oh my gosh. Do you realise how frustrating it is living over here in NZ and reading lots of American recipes that use &#8216;graham crackers&#8217; and you don&#8217;t know what the HECK they are. It seems rather defeatest to make cookies for the purpose of crushing them to make a cheesecake base or something, but I&#8217;m going to try it one day. I suspect they will be yummy on their own though, and I&#8217;ll have to fend my father off in order to keep them.</p>

				<p>I made these yesterday, along with Ina Garten&#8217;s homemade marshmallows, and then covered the bottoms of the graham crackers in a dark chocolate ganache &#8211; my roommates were so weirded out by the idea that I&#8217;d spend so much time making &#8220;gourmet s&#8217;mores&#8221; but after one each, they saw why!

				<p>I can&#8217;t believe you have 130 posts!  Well, yeah, I can because you have the most amazing blog.  I was feeling nostalgic for the graham crackers last winter, and oh yes, they were the pits! (remember your mother saying things were the pits?)<br />

				<p>We made these (same recipe) on New Year&#8217;s Eve for a fondue dinner.  With homemade marshmallows provided by our guests, and the chocolate fondue, they made fabulous s&#8217;mores!</p>

				<p>Wondering if you could use this dough to make a summertime gingerbread house for a childrens&#8217; party&#8230;.say, a beach house decorated with shells and such? Would be fun, and extra-special since the bounty of holiday cookies in December always seems to dim the uniqueness of a gingerbread house. I&#8217;m going to try this sometime for the grandkids I hope to have in the future!</p>

				<p>You should definitely get Nancy Silverton&#8217;s book &#8211; it&#8217;s really wonderful.  Her pumpkin pie recipe is amazing.  There is also a really nice recipe for graham crackers in Better Than Storebought &#8211; it&#8217;s out of print, but really worth tracking down a copy.</p>

<p>One quick question, Deb &#8211; how did you get that shape when you cut them?  Is there a cookie cutter knife with that shape on it?  Do you use the same knife to cut the edge of pie crusts, pasta, and the like?</p>

				<p>&#8220;Digestive biscuits&#8221;??  Um, I don&#8217;t even want to know what that could possibly be.  Is that what you eat after you&#8217;re done with your meal of blood pudding and shepherd&#8217;s pie?  These crackers, however, now <i>that&#8217;s</i> where it&#8217;s at&#8230;.</p>

I&#8217;ve been contemplating such an attempt since I stopped buying food items with high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils&#8230; and found that graham crackers is now off limits.

				<p>Just made these last night &#8211; AWESOME. I even remembered that I had printed out the 101 Cookbooks recipe years ago, but never got around to making them&#8230;why??? They are SO scrumptious. I didn&#8217;t have dark brown sugar, so I subbed about 2 tbsp of the honey for molasses. Thanks again for reminding me to make this treat!</p>

<p>so deb, how do you guys digest all that baking? to you hand them out to friends, or do they come over? i don&#8217;t think you two eat it all, do you? I recently am in a baking rampage and my pants are not happy&#8230; maybe i&#8217;ll pass it out on the train to work?</p>

				<p>Ok, I went ahead and made these today.  I have to say that my stuff NEVER comes out as cute and good looking as yours.  But they passed the taste test which is the most important thing.  The chilling step is very important, as is the baking on parchment I forgot on the first tray.  They came off, but not near as easy as the others.</p>

				<p>I was so impressed how amazing there turned out. Like the &#8220;real&#8221; version I grew up but so much better! We don&#8217;t have graham crackers where I live (NZ) and I&#8217;ve been longing for them. I used half the recipe to make a graham cracker crust for cheesecake. On their own and with the cake, they were delicious! Thank you for sharing.</p>

				<p>Just made these last week and I am SO impressed.  They were perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly, making smaller crackers just as you did.  I rolled a batch thicker and a batch thinner.  I liked the thinner, crispier version but those I had taste test also liked the thicker ones.  I made a cinnamon/brown sugar cream cheese to smear on top and it was the perfect snack to accompany a cup of coffee.</p>

				<p>Thank-you so much for publishing this post about graham crackers. I am an Aussie who gets your E-zine and just love your recipes. I also subscribe to E-mails from Martha Stewart, Rachel Ray and other good US recipe E-zines and have always meant to find out what exactly graham crackers are as they are included as an ingredient in many recipes. As we do not have them in Australia, I never thought to Google the name but found a good definition on Wikipedia. We do not have anything quite like this in Australia although Arnotts&#8217; Nice biscuits (cookies in US terms) are used for most of the same sort of recipes that graham crackers seem to be used in. As you say, the term cracker is a bit misleading, as crackers to us over here, are things that one would eat with cheese and processed meats like ham and salami or for eating with dips. </p>
<p>Thank-you do much for all of your wonderful posts. I am a big fan of smitten kitchen. Have you any good &#8220;tried and true&#8221; recipes for using butterscotch chips? Again, this is not an item that is used in Australian cooking but I do want to buy some (from an online US food supply company here in Australia, called <a href="http://www.USFoods.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.USFoods.com.au</a> from memory) and would appreciate some recipes that I can rely on.</p>

				<p>hi! these crackers look DEEELISH. i was just wondering if it was possible to form the dough into logs, refrigerate, then slice them up, like your chocolate wafers.. which by the way are fantastic too, i used them in the crust for a cheesecake. i&#8217;m not such a big fan of rolling out dough.</p>

				<p>I know this seems awfully goofy, but I made these for my dad and his dog.  They absolutely love them!  I do have to say though that I will try next time to roll the crackers out between sheets of parchment paper so that I won&#8217;t have to transport them from the floured counter to the pan.  Oh, and I will also use a fork to make my holes instead of poking them lots with a skewer.  :D</p>

				<p>hullo again! i baked the cookies and the rolled out ones turned out better. i rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper for minimal mess. they came out lovely and had a nice snap to them. somehow for the ones i cut from a log, i couldnt seem to get the thickness right they were either too thin or too thick. so i think i&#8217;ll stick to rolling out the dough the next time round. oh and i love that the recipe has honey in it!</p>

				<p>I used malt syrup instead of honey, and I can&#8217;t imagine it could taste any better. The strange bitter sweet taste of the malt syrup goes so well with the brown sugar it&#8217;s hard to describe. Malt syrup is a good, healthy alternative (and vegan/gluten free). The dough&#8217;s still chilling &#8211; I haven&#8217;t baked them yet &#8211; but I have high hopes!</p>

				<p>Some tips for new cracker bakers that I forgot since I last made crackers; 1. place crackers a small distance apart &#8211; if not they will puff up and grow together and will be unevenly done favoring the edges. You can still break them but they won&#8217;t look as nice. 2. If they do not seem crispy but are starting to burn, take them out and let them sit on the pan over the vent for the oven. This crisps them up well.</p>
<p>A great recipe all in all! Thanks so much!</p>

				<p>How long did these keep for?  I would like to make them for 4th of July but we are traveling a long distance.  How many days will they still be tasty if I make them and keep them air tight?</p>

				<p>Hi Deb-<br />
I made this recipe yesterday and the end result was another SK success for me. Having said that, it didn&#8217;t come together completely perfectly for me. Have you ever tried this with a standing mixer? I see from the pics you used a food processor but I used a standing mixer and I would advise against it.  Since the butter is frozen it doesn&#8217;t get cut into the flour by the paddle attachment in same way I imagine it would from a blade. So when my dough was pulled together and going into the fridge to chill overnight, I saw pretty large chunks of solid butter.  Also, this dough required more flour on the rolling surface than, say, your brownie roll out cookies (loved those!), but the baked cookies hold shape and turn out really nicely.<br />
I have more notes on my blog which I&#8217;ve linked from my name. I&#8217;ll post pics there.<br />
Thanks very much!</p>

				<p>These sound great!  My kids have conflicting food allergies (what one can eat, the other can&#8217;t&#8230;), and I have to make virtually everything from scratch.  I haven&#8217;t found any store-bought graham crackers they can have, and I sometimes feel like they&#8217;re deprived by not having any!  So glad to find a recipe for homemade graham crackers!  I&#8217;m going to try them today if the boys cooperate.</p>

				<p>I did make these, substituting the graham flour for the whole wheat. I made them with your marshmallow recipe (which is PERFECT!) and they came out great. My only mistake was to not realize how much they would crisp up as they cooled, so I baked them a bit too long and they ended up quite crunchy. But the flavor was wonderful and I will definitely make them again, just taking them out a little early. Thought my experience might be helpful to others too, though it&#8217;s probably pretty obvious&#8230;</p>

				<p>I am doing a table for a charity luncheon and my theme is &#8216;vintage school&#8217;. For a get to know each other snack I plan on milk in bottles with paper straws and homemade graham crackers. So, do I need to make these the morning of the luncheon or would the day before work? I am just not sure how well they keep in perfect condition. Thank you so much.<br />

				<p>I&#8217;m making these as I type this&#8230;well. Not AS I TYPE THIS&#8230;but, the dough is in the fridge now. I&#8217;ve never made graham crackers  before, so I really had/have no idea what to expect. I&#8217;ll admit I was a little worried pouring so much vanilla extract in&#8230; But as SOON as I handled the dough and the smell of it wafted up, I knew this was right. I haven&#8217;t even baked them yet and I KNOW these will be &#8216;the ones&#8217;. I just feel mildly sad that I intend to use them as a crust for my pumpkin pie&#8230; :&lt;</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing this recipe. *skitters off to find a different crust*</p>

				<p>Ok..I&#8217;ve never been a fan of graham crackers, ever. Which is why I&#8217;ve never cared for s&#8217;mores. Chocolate? Abso-friggin-lutely. Marshmallows? meh(always seemed&#8230;chalky? to me). BUT, then I found a recipe for homemade marshmallows. THEN I found this recipe. My kids like s&#8217;mores, I like cooking, baking. :)  So I made both in one night. I&#8217;m apparently a glutton for punishment, and live in a kitchen that&#8217;s a constant disaster. The crackers are awesome! (marshmallows too, btw) I too wonder why they are called crackers, and not &#8216;cookies&#8217;. My husband&#8211;whom doesn&#8217;t eat sweets, came in and tried one out of sheer curiosity, and perhaps the glare in my eye that insinuated a horrible night for him if he didn&#8217;t&#8211;wouldn&#8217;t stop stuffing them in his face. But alas, my question is this: If I were to make a graham cracker crust for my inadvertant purchase of some cute pumpkins&#8211;that I thought were just small, and turned out to be for pies&#8211;how do you recommend I go about doing so? Should I just crush? And do I add the butter and sugar like others say to do for store bought, or no sugar? (I&#8217;m worried it would be too sweet). OR should I just make the recipe and instead of cutting, line the pie pan with it? Poke holes and blind bake, or fill and bake? Sorry if this is a bit overwhelming, but I&#8217;ve only ever made one pumpkin type pie, and that was actually a pumpkin cheesecake with shortbread crust. My thinking is that I should line the pie pan with the recipe as is, and perhaps partially bake it, then fill and finish. Please advise! Thanks.</p>

				<p>You can make a graham cracker crust with these according to any graham cracker crust recipe &#8212; same as you would with store-bought. I wouldn&#8217;t advise rolling this out and making a crust of it. It wouldn&#8217;t work the same.</p>

				<p>I finally made these! THANK YOU!!!! As someone who hasn&#8217;t been able to eat a graham cracker in over 10 years, YAY! I used spelt flour, using the same proportions of white &amp; whole grain as your suggestion, plus a scant tsp of xanthan gum.</p>
<p>I did have a question, though: I&#8217;m learning to bake by using your site, so I&#8217;m a little clueless. I kept thinking they were done, pulling them out, and finding that the ones in the middle of the tray were soggy (uneven oven). Put em back in, try again&#8230; Suddenly, the cooling rack occurred to me. When I decided they couldn&#8217;t possibly need to cook longer, I threw em on. The problem: Not burnt at all, in fact delish, but some cooled to be really really hard. What level of stiffness are we looking for when they&#8217;re still hot?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll definitely be making these again, though I think I&#8217;ll cut back on the sugar just a tad. BTW the salt&#8211;brilliant.</p>

				<p>First of all, thanks Deb for sharing this as I&#8217;m an American living in Australia and am always frustrated by not being able to buy certain American staples, particularly graham crackers as they are called for by a number of classic recipes (thanks to Bern for posting the website for an online US shopping site, the correct address is <a href="http://www.usafoods.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.usafoods.com.au</a> but at $10.99 &#8211; can you believe that! &#8211; for a single box of very ordinary crackers, I am more apt to make my own).  Most recently when we went camping and my husband was unable to bring home a box of graham crackers for the s&#8217;mores I had planned on introducing to our Australian friends as well as our dear half aussie children, the last time he was in the US for business (he being an Australian didn&#8217;t really give it the priority it deserved!).  So this year, I&#8217;m planning to put together s&#8217;mores kits to give for the holidays with home made graham crackers and marshmallows (as written in SK with egg whites &#8211; why is everyone afraid of using egg whites these days?) and a bar of gourmet dark chocolate complete with skewers and written instructions of how to assemble them, to our Australian friends and family and to homesick expats like me.  As it is summer during the holidays and high BBQ and camping season, I thought it would much more appropriate than giving home made marshmallows and cocoa mix!</p>
<p>Secondly, just wondering if anyone has tried the Graham Cracker recipe from French Laundry found in the epicurious website: <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Campfire-Smores-15300?pg=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Campfire-Smores-15300?pg=2</a>.  There seems to be significant variations in terms of amount of butter (far more, almost twice) and sugar (far less, almost half) used for the cracker. Deb, do you find the graham cracker a tad sweet, particularly when used to make s&#8217;mores? Could the amount of sugar be decreased without altering texture? Also, would you recommend to increase the amount of butter if substituting 1/2 cup pastry flour? Please advise!</p>

				<p>Jung Yoon &#8212; I have not tried the French Laundry recipe, but now I must. I would say that these graham crackers are sweet, but not more so than the ones you buy; they have a slight chewy density to them that the originals don&#8217;t have. I am not sure if you can decrease the sugar because I have not tried. Do let us know if you do.</p>
<p>I find the comments on that recipe hilarious, btw. People are <i>appalled</i> that the magazine suggests they may be interested in making a version of their favorite junk food at home. Like, many commenters are actually angry. I guess times have changed a bit in the last decade.</p>

				<p>Thank you! I am so happy you listed this cookie/cracker here.  My youngest daughter LOVES Graham Crackers and believe it or not I never even thought of making them, even though I LOVE to bake at the holidays.  How goofy of me&#8230; I wonder if it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s called Cracker if that&#8217;s why I never thought of baking them.  Weird.. anyway, thank you very much I know my daughter will love it.  I&#8217;ll have to surprise her. :)</p>

				<p>These crackers combined with your marshmallows make for perfect homemade s&#8217;mores! The flavor is perfectly &#8216;graham,&#8217; and they have a great snap to them. I did end up cooking them almost the full 25 minutes, btw, and they came out perfectly (though not nearly as pretty as uniform as yours!).</p>

				<p>Hmm, I expected to love these, as Honey Maids with peanut butter is one of my FAVORITE late night snacks! The dough stayed in the fridge for 2 days, which may have had an effect on the result. I did need quite a lot of flour to roll it out, but every batch seemed to bake strangely. Batch 1 I didn&#8217;t pre-freeze (time constraints) and the dough stuck to my Silpat, so rather than scrape them off for freezing, I baked them in place, pre-scored, as one gigundous cookie. The edges ended up crispy and the middles more like semi-soft gingers. Batch 2 and 3 that were frozen for 10 minutes or so kept overbaking, even with fewer than 13 minutes of bake time. I&#8217;m eating them now after them being in Tupperware overnight, and they&#8217;re just not very good. The soft ones feel stale (batch 1, and they are the best of the bunch) and the crispy ones are way too crunchy for me. The flavor is nice, but I can&#8217;t imagine making these again. Did anyone else get these results; did I do something wrong?</p>

				<p>They are BEAUTIFUL! Thanks so much for all the recipes! I ended up cooking them even shorter (using a convection oven here, and it tends to have that effect). I think the total time was 8 minutes. One thing I would note for others, though, is that you have to wait for them to cool to get crispy. I tried one when warm and was slightly disappointed because it was just soft and chewy. About 5 minutes later, however, they were fantastic.</p>

				<p>I made these today &#8212; a rainy day in Ohio &#8212; with only one modification: agave syrup instead of honey. The dry dough resisted being rolled out and easily tore apart. So, I made some in the traditional cracker form and othes as round cutouts. Nevertheless, I am thrilled with the result &#8212; the kosher salt is a fantastic addition! The results are worth the wait!</p>

				<p>These were wonderful!  My daughter went on her first overnight with a friend today, and they are going camping.  I made graham crackers and marshmallows for them to take, her friend&#8217;s family is providing the chocolate.  Mostly homemade s&#8217;mores!  I think they&#8217;ll be amazing.</p>
<p>These are more sturdy and slightly sweeter than boxed grahams. I microwaved one cracker and one marshmallow for 15 seconds and the sweetness balance was just like the s&#8217;mores I remember.  I do not have any chocolate in the house right now though (what an awful statement that is!), so I am not sure how milk chocolate would affect the balance.  I think it will be fine.</p>
<p>Also, I chilled the dough in the freezer and everything rolled out wonderfully. Do flour very liberally, the excess is absorbed right into the cracker as it bakes.  On the few that had a little flour dust when they came out of the oven, it brushed right off when they were cool.</p>

				<p>My first batch just came out of the oven. These are soooo good!  Perfectly sweet and crunchy.  I almost over baked mine b/c they were still soft. They crunch up when the cool so if they LOOK done, take them out.  I&#8217;m in Italy and they don&#8217;t know what brown sugar is unfortunately.  I used organic demerara cane sugar instead.  I was worried about crunchy sugar bits in the crackers but they are cruchy enough that you don&#8217;t notice and the flavor is way better than subing white sugar.  Thanks!  I&#8217;ve been wanting to make graham crackers for a while!</p>

				<p>Interesting recipe, although for it to truly be called graham cracker it should be made with graham flour, not white flour. </p>
<p>If you were planing on making a &#8220;graham cracker&#8221; crust from this recipe, why not cut a &#8220;cracker the size of your spring form pan and back it in there, then when it cools, just add the filling, no need to crush any crackers, plus you can cut back a bit on the butter and feel less guilty about having a second slice.</p>
<p>on a side note: I&#8217;ve never seen graham crackers at the store with any sort of sugar coating, but I live in a small town, so that may be why.</p>

				<p>Graham flour is mentioned in the post&#8230; However, my goal was to approximate the graham cracker flavor we know and love without sending people on a treasure hunt for an ingredient not sold at most grocery stores. </p>
<p>A few people have suggested just using this dough as a crust, but I&#8217;m not sure I agree it is the answer. Crumb crusts have different textures, a finely ground, tender thing going on that you wouldn&#8217;t get from a large cookie. That said, I don&#8217;t think anyone would complain, either way you made it.</p>

				<p>Just wanted to say thank you.  I have a batch out of the oven and another in the oven.  And that&#8217;s just half of the dough!  It is yummy.  I wound up using just white flour and light brown sugar, because it&#8217;s what I had at home.  Cut it into 1.5 inch squares, because I&#8217;m feeing it to my kids, no need to break cookies, like store bought ones.  TAs you stated, the dough is really sticky, had to apply a lot of dustings of sugar.  But mainly, thank you to you for all the research that you do.  I can&#8217;t just buy graham crackers at the store because of the corn syrup, as my son is allergic to it.  So this is wonderful. More snack options available to him with homemade goodies.</p>

				<p>i am not a graham cracker crust fan &#8211; but what if you made this the exact size of you cheesecake pan and didn&#8217;t crush it up.  maybe lightly back it just to set up and then pour your cheesecake batter on top and bake.   hmmmmm</p>

				<p>I just tried making these for my sick boyfriend (poor thing has mono!) and I baked them all of twenty minutes, and they were completely burned black. I have an oven thermometer and the temp was definitely 350. Going to try again tonight with only 10/12 mins in the oven. Hopefully they&#8217;ll come out okay this time!</p>

				<p>Made these for a pumpkin cream pie crust for Thanksgiving and they ARE INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p>They TOTALLY outshone the pie&#8230;but that is a good problem to have! I froze the rest and will take them out for another pie at Christmas. I&#8217;ll look for a more robustly-flavored filling next time. Maybe something cranberry? Ideas?</p>

				<p>I made these the other day, and they are fantastic.  Seemed to taste like cookie dough, so I went with using a very small biscuit cutter ( I can&#8217;t seem to cut a straight line) and made them like little  cookie bites.  I also upped the cinnamon, so it had more sass to it.  Result was a cookie-graham, I suppose. Great base recipe, versatile.  Thanks for posting it.</p>

				<p>I just made these, gluten free. Thought I&#8217;d give my substitutions in case anyone else wants to try. In place of the flours, I used:</p>
<p>2-1/4 cup brown rice flour<br />
3/4 cup potato starch<br />
2 T gf flour substitute<br />
1/2 t. xanthan gum</p>
<p>The rest I made the same. It came out nicely (although the texture was slightly rice flour-y), but I might back off the vanilla a touch.</p>

				<p>If anyone else finds themselves in a hurry, I&#8217;ve found they disappear just as quickly when you simply roll the dough out on parchment paper and bake as one giant cookie&#8230;  I use a pizza cutter to slice it up into squares just after it comes out of the oven.  The edges are a bit, er, rustic&#8230; but I haven&#8217;t heard any complaints! Very good and easy kid treat.</p>

				<p>Thank you, I like &#8216;em &#8211; a whole bunch!! I believe they should be called &#8216;Graham Wafers&#8217;. Used a half-cup of whole wheat + half-cup oat flour + 2 Tbsp of rice flour (+ balance unbleached AP) &#8211; all sifted together. I think that helped keep the crispness. MM-</p>
