<p style="text-align: left;">The sun has finally come out for more than an hour!  I&#8217;m celebrating with open toed shoes! It&#8217;s still very humid but I&#8217;ll take it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I bought this dress on super sale in the Fall and have worn it several times, but just never managed to capture a picture of it.  It&#8217;s a great simple dress in a lovely shade of grey.  Jersey dresses make life easier.  They are comfortable AND polished and they make getting dressed in the morning quick and painless &#8211; just add shoes and accessories.  That being said, not all jersey dresses work for me and I won&#8217;t wear any jersey dress with out wearing my spanx.  In comment on <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/04/20/20-april-2011-oh-the-things-you-can-do/#comment-36281">one of E.&#8217;s jersey dress posts</a> reader Holly asked about our use of shapewear when wearing jersey.   I can&#8217;t speak for the other chics, but <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2009/10/20/20-october-2009/">I love my spanx</a> and my knock-off spanx and am not comfortable in a jersey dress without them.  Jersey shows everything!  For this dress I wore my thicker knock-off spanx I purchased at Target a few years ago because I really wanted a smooth line but wasn&#8217;t worried about the dress being too tight.    What about you?  What kind of shapewear do you use and with what garments?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Earring turned necklace by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5663292550/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5663292550_74a25696a0.jpg" alt="Earring turned necklace" width="450" height="362" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For my little pop of color in this neutral palette I wore my neck jade-colored pendant.  I bought this pair of jade earrings from a street vendor just outside China Town in San Francisco.  I loved the shape and color and thought they would be a great addition to my short-hair earring collection.  Unfortunately, they are way too heavy &#8211; they stretch my earlobes (which I&#8217;m worried could have permanent effects).   So, I just removed the earring hook and strong the pendant on a silver chain&#8230;voila I have a new statement necklace!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ok, one more day of classes!  I can do it!  Hope the semester is wrapping up nicely for all of you!</p>

I&#8217;ve worn this dress a lot since I bought it at a consignment shop this winter (same place that <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/04/25/25-april-2011-new-to-me/">A. picked up her fab new blouse</a>!), and I&#8217;ve consistently struggled with what to do about the <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/02/28/28-february-2011-winter-remix/">ruffle around the neckline</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Ruffles and Pearls by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5643118843/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5065/5643118843_f37fcc3af8.jpg" alt="Ruffles and Pearls" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Well, genius that I am, I decided at 7:00am yesterday morning that the back part of the ruffle had got to go, so I took out my trusty scissors and happily took out the stitching holding on the back half. Why I hadn&#8217;t done this earlier, I&#8217;m not sure. Why I chose to do it at 7:00am in the morning while still a little delirious, I&#8217;m also not sure about. Regardless of the mysterious ways my addled morning-brain works, I&#8217;m happy with the results.</p>
<p><a title="Stretch by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5643685272/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5643685272_43d5872a23_z.jpg" alt="Stretch" width="480" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had this sweater for a while and it was just about to go in the &#8220;swap-heap&#8221; before it was rescued for this outfit. It seemed good in theory to have a lightweight, cashmere, mushroom-brown cropped sweater, but in practice it has proven less practical. I&#8217;m not sure that this one outfit will totally redeem it, but it will at least survive until next fall because (drum roll) I&#8217;m packing up my winter clothes this weekend! I&#8217;m doing this in preparation both for spring (to finally arrive) and for a clothing swap I&#8217;m organizing next week. No better time than a season shift to clean out the old closet! A. and E. are hosting a swap soon as well, so keep your eyes out for some upcoming weekend workshops on the topic!</p>

<p>Finally, getting to the title of my post &#8211; I know I wear belts a lot, and I completely blame A. for this habit. I told you during belt week that <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/03/03/diy-ribbon-belt-with-button-closure/">belting is the gateway drug to becoming style obsessed</a> (in a non-self destructive, good kind of way). However, my waist is not always happy being squished, and depending on how much I&#8217;ve consumed, my belts can get a little bit tight &#8212; until I found this belt on clearance at Anthropologie when A. and I were shopping in Boston. I know that plastic is generally not good for the environment, but stretchy, forgiving materials are very good for my post-winter but pre-spring training body, and this belt is plenty stretchy and very comfy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 27 weeks now, and depending on what source you go with, I&#8217;m either in the last week of my second trimester or the first week of my third trimester. Either way, I&#8217;m getting into the home stretch of this pregnancy. While I don&#8217;t mind being pregnant most of the time, I can&#8217;t wait to be done as T. and I are sooo impatient and excited to have our little girl already born and out in the world with us. Every time I see a baby these days, I get more excited about meeting my own.</p>
<p>As for dressing my &#8217;2/3 there&#8217; body &#8230; it&#8217;s been challenging lately. Mostly because the weather has been so inconsistent and I keep having to revert to colder temperatures clothing, which I&#8217;ve either already outgrown or have worn so much that I&#8217;m thoroughly bored with it. Thus, I&#8217;ve been lacking in inspiration and just admiring how <a href="http://www.academichic.com/tag/e-all/">beautiful E. looks</a> and how effortless she makes this whole thing look. I&#8217;ve also been incredibly busy with the semester coming to an end, and with a deadline to turn in a completed chapter draft to my dissertation advisor, which has also left me with little interest in anything but looking presentable and getting out the door quickly in the mornings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="27 April 2011 by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5661699458/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5030/5661699458_aeea6a0779_b.jpg" alt="27 April 2011" width="328" height="491" /></a></p>
<p>Enter my fail proof go-to outfit&#8230; I&#8217;ve worn iterations of this combo many times but just haven&#8217;t had a chance to record it. The basic premise is pairing a comfortable maternity skirt (this one is inherited from E&#8217;s last pregnancy) with some kind of top that still fits me, and then adding the two magic ingredients:  This structured navy JCrew blazer and my most comfortable Report wedges. Both these items add a dash of polish and professionalism to an otherwise casual look of maternity skirt+top combo. It&#8217;s not the most exciting outfit in the world, but it gets the job done. Incidentally, when E. wore and documented this skirt during her first pregnancy, she also paired it with a structured navy blazer, although she kept things more casual with colorful flats&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(Thanks, E, for a great maternity skirt!)</p>
<p>This week is our last week of classes and after Thursday, I will just have final grades to turn in. Although I&#8217;ve somewhat lost my mojo in the fashion department, I can look back on this year and feel really good about everything else that got done. I taught my first ever 5 course load, designed my own syllabus for one of those classes, managed to write 1.5 chapters of my dissertation, co-advised a student group, and still found time to cook more, learn to bake bread, ride my bike, take my dog on walks, and spend quality time with my husband. Oh yeah, and I&#8217;ve been growing a baby for much of this time. So I&#8217;m ok with having been less innovative in the &#8216;getting dressed&#8217; department. It was just one of those things that became less important to me as these other things took precedence.</p>
<p>As we enter into warmer summer weather and I enter my third trimester, I&#8217;m hopeful that some of my fashion mojo might come back for that last stretch of pregnancy. I&#8217;m looking forward to having summer dresses, casual sandals, and more time at my disposal. As for the next academic year? I&#8217;m taking the Fall semester off to be at home with the baby and then will possibly teach in the Spring if the dissertation fellowship I applied for doesn&#8217;t pan out. But either way, it looks like I have a long stretch of working from home while caring for a baby ahead of me. So I&#8217;d love to hear it from those other moms out there &#8211; <em>how do you manage to get work done while at home with a little one? What are some strategies that have helped you stay productive if you work from home and have kids to take care of? Please share! </em>~ S.</p>

<p>Remember this <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/04/15/15-april-2011-floaty/">thrifted midi-length skirt</a>? I am really, truly in love with it now. Really, there&#8217;s something about the diaphanous nature of this skirt that makes walking seem inadequate. I wanted to glide, to float, to skip, or to twirl.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="27 April 2011 - Diaphanous by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5659682537/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5659682537_d6d44836cd_z.jpg" alt="27 April 2011 - Diaphanous" width="453" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>But, since today was a teaching day and twirling needed to be tempered with some authority, I grounded the outfit with a structured jacket and architectural platform wedges. Then, as a sly wink to my students, I added in my little Victorian-cat-in-a-dress necklace. It is, after all, the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Midi-length skirts are legendary for being &#8220;difficult to wear.&#8221; I&#8217;m not an expert on different body shapes, and I&#8217;ve grown increasingly skeptical of &#8220;rules&#8221; that limit the kinds of silhouettes I &#8220;should&#8221; wear. What I do know, though, is that when I wear this skirt it feels like a playful vintage throwback and it has significant mood-lifting capabilities. I can do that.</p>
<p>For those who might be toying with the idea of trying a midi skirt, the prevailing advice relating to wearing midi&#8217;s is to pair them with tall shoes. I have to say that, thus far, I agree with this general rule of thumb as it helps prevent visual stumpage (though I can also imagine wearing this skirt with flat boots as a transitional outfit into fall). To this wisdom, I would add that drapier, floatier materials, like this one, also seem like a wise choice, not only because they make for better twirling, but because the lightness of the fabric balances the overall volume at hand. I think that a hem length like this is the kind of thing where you just have to try something on at different lengths and with different shoes, while being willing to surrender the idea that this is going to make you look as tall as you can possibly be.</p>
<p>And, you know, if it doesn&#8217;t work out, then you won&#8217;t have to avert your eyes when, in ten years, the above and below photos stand a good chance of looking utterly dated and ridiculous. Ah, an ephemeral AND diaphanous skirt. Fitting.</p>

<p>Like many places it seems, Academichic Central is in danger of being washed away with all this rain!</p>
<p>Multiple days of heavy rain mean to things: my wellies are getting a workout and my hair is ridiculously curly. I&#8217;ve been trying to take advantage of the short breaks in the rain to fit in a run, plant something, or do other outside projects.  I keep reminding myself that all this rain is good for my new plants, my compost, and my lawn.  Plus, I feel really &#8220;hard-core&#8221; when I start my run in the sun and finish it in a down pour or when I have to slip on my wellies to slop through the muddy lawn to my compost bin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="26 April 2011 by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5655413231/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5655413231_1631b56b14_z.jpg" alt="26 April 2011" width="448" height="332" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, this means when I finally get cleaned up to head to campus, I don&#8217;t want to look like I am wearing my rain gear.  The rain was too persistent (and my trek through campus too long) to wear regular shoes, so I opted for my secret wellies (people often can&#8217;t tell they are rubber instead of leather).  Like L., <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/04/25/rain-rain-go-away/">instead of using bright colors, I found other things in my closet to make me think of spring</a>.  I chose this light gauzy scarf and wooden accessories &#8211; items that make me think of <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2009/01/25/25-january-2009-3/">sunny islands</a> rather than rainy cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Come on May flowers!</p>

Spring is taking its sweet time coming to my neck-of-the-woods, and in the meantime it&#8217;s been grey and rainy for what feels like months (real time: probably only a few days out of each week for the last few weeks). I&#8217;m not sure about you, but my mood is more than a little influenced by the weather, so all these cloudy, chilly days have not been making me too happy. However, I am happy that April is national poetry month! Today especially, I&#8217;m reminded of T. S. Eliot&#8217;s &#8220;The Waste Land&#8221; and some of the most famous lines in all of poetry:</p>
<blockquote><p>April is the cruellest month, breeding<br />
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br />
Memory and desire, stirring<br />
Dull roots with spring rain.</p></blockquote>
<p>After a rain soaked weekend, I decided to dress like the spring rain and dull roots and don blue and grey. This is basically another version of a <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2010/08/23/23-august-2010-rainy-days-and-mondays-3/">monochrome outfit</a> I put together last summer for our <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2009/02/22/fashion-101-how-to-combine-colors-monochrome-and-split-complementaries-2/">Color Wheel Challenge</a>. As for memory and desire, well, the memory of past summers is the only thing making me smile in this picture.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5643117265/in/photostream">subtle embroidered flowers on the skirt</a> and my flower belt also perked me up a bit, and I wore my green torsade in an effort to convince myself that all the rain really was bringing new, fresh, green things into the world. Usually I try to wear bright colors on days when I&#8217;m feeling low or the weather is bad, but today it was wearing little hints of spring that me happier. What are your tricks for changing your mood or combating a dreary climate?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">While visiting L. last weekend (so we could watch a friend run the Boston Marathon) I scored several new-to-me items.  L. was in the process of cleaning out her closet to get ready for a clothing swap she is organizing, but she let me have first dibs!  I came home with a few great things including this beautiful black pencil skirt.  I was running out of light when I took these pictures so you can&#8217;t see its lovely texture or the great kick pleat in the back.  The skirt was too long on L. but is the perfect length on me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="25 April 2011 by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5651478862/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5261/5651478862_eaa0754668_z.jpg" alt="25 April 2011" width="512" height="393" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This fun patterned blouse is also new-to-me.  I picked it up at a consignment shop in Boston (the one purchase I allowed myself to make, despite the many tempting shops L. and I wondered into).  It&#8217;s not at all my typical style: it has a bold (non-stripe) pattern, puffed sleeves, a tie at the neck, little bead buttons on the shoulder, and a bib front.  But, for some reason I was really drawn to it.  I like the funky modern pattern mixed with a more vintage cut.  Both L. and E. agree with me that this has quite an S. vibe</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Shirt/Earring Detail by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5650913095/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5261/5650913095_f59e63d36d_z.jpg" alt="Shirt/Earring Detail" width="448" height="330" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And, as I&#8217;m a rediscovering my collection of large earrings, I emphasized the drama of the graphic pattern with these big cut-out black earrings &#8211; a hand-me-down from my little sister.  This outfit gave me a much-needed boost of confidence for some not-so-pleasant meetings on campus.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="25 April 2011 - Outer wear by academichic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/academichic/5650911049/"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5184/5650911049_d01f07d8e9_z.jpg" alt="25 April 2011 - Outer wear" width="512" height="430" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I like that the blouse is a bit playful even with its more severe and formal cut.  I emphasized the playful/casual side by choosing boots instead of pumps and my denim jacket instead of a trench. <br />
I have always loved hand-me-downs!  When I was little my mom used to come home with bags full of clothes from a friend at work who had two girls, each just a year older than my older sister and I.  We were always so excited to dig through the clothes and pick out what we wanted.  Their clothes were always much trendier than what my mom bought (which had to be timeless enough to pass through 5 girls).  I didn&#8217;t even mind hand-me-downs from my sister since she was older and cooler (plus, as I&#8217;m the second oldest, my hand-me-downs only came through one sister).  I still love getting my friends and sister&#8217;s unwanted items.<br />
What about you?  Where you a hand-me-down kid?  Are you still?</p>

                    <p>Remember our <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/03/18/friday-study-break-giveaway-win-a-200-karen-kane-giftcard/">Karen Kane giveaway</a> from last month? Kate was the lucky winner of the $200 shopping spree at <a href="http://www.karenkane.com/">Karen Kane</a>, which included a consultation with a personal stylist in the store.</p>
<p>Kate met with stylist Tracey at a Minneapolis based Karen Kane shop. The two looked for comfortable and easy pieces that Kate could take on her backpacking trip to Europe. Kate was also trying to add more rich and colorful pieces to her closet full of black and neutrals. We were excited to see some shots from Kate&#8217;s shopping day at Karen Kane (and thought we&#8217;d share them with you too) and to hear that the event was a success. Tracey loved working with Kate and we heard that Kate left thrilled with her new purchases. (And on a side note, doesn&#8217;t Kate have the best haircut?) Below are some of the items Kate tried on&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>End Notes:</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s ended up being a crazy week in my household and while I opted for <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/04/20/20-april-2011-oh-the-things-you-can-do/">easy earlier this week</a>, yesterday I&#8217;m went for can&#8217;t-help-but-smile.</p>
<p>When I was pregnant with little e., the first time that I <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2009/04/13/13-april-2009-above-the-belt/">belted below the bump</a> was a big deal to me, both personally and stylistically. This time around, I&#8217;m more comfortable with my changing shape, and it&#8217;s time once again to embrace a silhouette that is preggers-specific.</p>

<p>And now, it&#8217;s time to hustle everyone off to the airport for a weekend visit to N.&#8217;s family for Easter&#8230;</p>

<p>First, a few words on the outfit: I thrifted this dress during the winter, while it was too cold to wear it, but I bought it in anticipation of it working as a maternity dress.  Besides loving the wild paisley print and beautiful warm colors, I also loved that it was jersey (read: stretchy) and with a high waist. And here I am at 25 weeks (when this picture was taken) and fitting perfectly into it. I foresee this one fitting me for a while still. I cannot wait for summer, when I&#8217;ll be able to live in stretchy comfortable dresses &#8211; my favorite maternity outfit for sure.</p>

<p>Second, I&#8217;d like to thank you all for chiming in with such great comments and points of discussion on<a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/04/18/j-crew-and-gender-bending-outcries/"> my post from Monday</a>. I raised the issue of the media outcry regarding the pink-toenailed J.Crew boy and so many of you had such <a href="http://www.academichic.com/2011/04/18/j-crew-and-gender-bending-outcries/#comments">great things to add</a>. I was particularly fascinated by the thread of discussion regarding the use of children in media and for advertising purposes. While I had focused on the gender talk surrounding this event, many of you noted another interesting issue at play here: using children to promote and advertise companies or products. I haven&#8217;t given this enough thought to formulate a concise opinion on this yet, but I&#8217;m glad for the incentive to ponder this.</p>
<p>I also appreciated the viewpoint brought by those who noted the paradox between all the anti-bullying talk we&#8217;ve had in the media lately and the bullying tone and comments made by those same personalities regarding this boy and his mother now. How quickly we seem to forget that just a few months ago, everyone was talking about the need to educate our youths and to ensure bully-free zones in our schools and communities. Dan Savage, one of my favorite writers and podcast personalities, started the <a href="http://www.itgetsbetter.org/pages/about-it-gets-better-project/">It Gets Better Project </a>with his husband Terry. President Obama contributed a video along with many straight allies and well known public figures. Yet here we are, still listening to certain members of the media openly and unabashedly engaging in the kind of bullying that we were trying to eradicate.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really have an answer or a message for all of this, I just wanted to highlight the great point raised by so many about the role of bullying in this discussion. I&#8217;m hopeful though, that despite the inevitable setbacks, our society can keep moving forward towards acceptance and respect for all its members. I have to be hopeful. I&#8217;m bringing a new little member into this world and I have to believe that we&#8217;re progressing and not regressing in our worldviews and ways of interracting with each other.</p>
