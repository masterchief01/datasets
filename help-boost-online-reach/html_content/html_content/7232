          Processed Meats Declared Too Dangerous for Human Consumption</h2>

					<p><img src="http://www.totalhealthbreakthroughs.com/newsletter/images/issue20/main.jpg" alt="Hot Dogs" hspace="5" width="234" height="154" align="right" />The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) has just completed a detailed review of more than 7,000 clinical studies covering links between diet and cancer. Its conclusion is rocking the health world with startling bluntness: Processed meats are too dangerous for human consumption. Consumers should stop buying and eating all processed meat products <em>for the rest of their lives</em>.</p>
<p>Processed meats include bacon, sausage, hot dogs, sandwich meat, packaged ham, pepperoni, salami and virtually all red meat used in frozen prepared meals. They are usually manufactured with a carcinogenic ingredient known as sodium nitrite. This is used as a color fixer by meat companies to turn packaged meats a bright red color so they look fresh. Unfortunately, sodium nitrite also results in the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines in the human body. And this leads to a sharp increase in cancer risk for those who eat them.</p>
<p>A 2005 University of Hawaii study found that processed meats increase the risk of pancreatic cancer by 67 percent. Another study revealed that every 50 grams of processed meat consumed daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 50 percent. These are alarming numbers. Note that these cancer risks do not come from eating fresh, non-processed meats. They only appear in people who regularly consume processed meat products containing sodium nitrite.</p>
<p>Sodium nitrite appears predominantly in red meat products (you won&#8217;t find it in chicken or fish products). Here&#8217;s a short list of food items to check carefully for sodium nitrite and monosodium glutamate (MSG), another dangerous additive:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Beef jerky</li>
<li>Bacon</li>
<li>Sausage</li>
<li>Hot dogs</li>
<li>Sandwich meat</li>
<li>Frozen pizza with meat</li>
<li>Canned soups with meat</li>
<li>Frozen meals with meat</li>
<li>Ravioli and meat pasta foods</li>
<li>Kid&#8217;s meals containing red meat</li>
<li>Sandwich meat used at popular restaurants</li>
<li>Nearly all red meats sold at public schools, restaurants, hospitals, hotels and theme parks</li>
</ul>
<p>If sodium nitrite is so dangerous to humans, why do the FDA and USDA continue to allow this cancer-causing chemical to be used? The answer, of course, is that food industry interests now dominate the actions by U.S. government regulators. The USDA, for example, tried to ban sodium nitrite in the late 1970&#8242;s but was overridden by the meat industry. It insisted the chemical was safe and accused the USDA of trying to &#8220;ban bacon.&#8221; Today, the corporations that dominate American food and agricultural interests hold tremendous influence over the FDA and USDA. Consumers are offered no real protection from dangerous chemicals intentionally added to foods, medicines and personal care products.</p>
<p>You can protect yourself and your family from the dangers of processed meats by following a few simple rules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Always read ingredient labels.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy anything made with sodium nitrite or monosodium glutamate.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t eat red meats served by restaurants, schools, hospitals, hotels or other institutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>And finally, eat more fresh produce with every meal. There is evidence that natural vitamin C found in citrus fruits and exotic berries (like camu camu) helps prevent the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines, protecting you from the devastating health effects of sodium nitrite in processed meats. The best defense, of course, is to avoid eating processed meats altogether.</p>

						<p>Haha.  I love it.  The first comment comes from a guy who&#8217;s obviously not well-educated in how consumption of carcinogens affects a body holistically.  I usually try to give the benefit of the doubt to plebs &#8211; hell I ain&#8217;t no jean-e-us neither&#8230;but then he has the audacity to call the author an idiot!

						<p>Really, though, this is fear-mongering published by someone with a spiritual, political, and probably financial agenda. There is as much sodium nitrate in 119 hot dogs as there is in one beet and as much in 467 hot dogs as there is in one serving of arugula. Believe science, not superstition.</p>

						<p>[...] Processed meats include bacon, sausage, hot dogs, sandwich meat, packaged ham, pepperoni, salami and virtually all red meat used in frozen prepared meals.They are usually manufactured with a carcinogenic ingredient known as sodium nitrite. This is used as a color fixer by meat companies to turn packaged meats a bright red color so they look fresh. Unfortunately, sodium nitrite also results in the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines in the human body. And this leads to a sharp increase in cancer risk for those who eat them.

						<p>I still think it always boils down to the old adage.  Everything in moderation.  There have always been a lot of people growing old that probably had that in common with their lifestyle.  Just because you eat a frozen pizza, or enjoy a good ol&#8217; rare T-Bone cooked to perfection, does not mean your mistreating yourself.<br />
God bless, and &#8230; all together now&#8230;<br />
My bologna has a first name, it&#8217;s O-s-c-a-r, my bologna has a second name it&#8217;s m-a-y-e-r.  Oh, I love to eat it twice a day, and if you ask me I will saaaaaay<br />

						<p>Processed meats are delicious, we are mortal, and thus going to die anyways, and it takes a heck of a lot of chemicals to cause cancer, and even then it will only happen if your body decides to break down on a massive scale anyways. Mind, a straight SPAM diet isn&#8217;t going to do wonders for your health, so throw in some other varieties of foods, especially fruits and veggies, drink water, and be content in the fact that YOU ARE GOING TO DIE, SO ENJOY LIFE WHILE YOU HAVE ONE.*</p>

						<p>Jill &#8211; Cancer doesn&#8217;t happen because &#8220;your body decides to break down on a massive scale anyways.&#8221; Do a little bit of research about it, cancer CAN and IS caused by a higher concentration of types of chemicals and certain exposures throughout your life (i.e. why one bad sun exposure can mutate cells in your skin, causing skin cancer). </p>
<p>Agree with the moderation thing. In a perfect world we would all eat only healthy things, look great feel awesome, and probably be miserable. Live life how you see fit, but don&#8217;t jump to conclusions either way.</p>

						<p>I must say this article has shocked me &#8211; i never thought to google &#8216;are processed meats dangerous&#8217; before.<br />
My perspective on the matter &#8211; everything in moderation. Thats what these scientists are forgetting. Most of these shock articles apply to those who KNOW they eat too much of it.<br />
Although in this case, they are recommending you to stop eating ALL processed meats. Well to that i say &#8216;Good luck&#8217;<br />
They make their way into everything&#8230;</p>

						<p>gentlemen,<br />
I have been in the gourmet beef jerky business for over three years now and have tried to educate my customers on the dangers of the two chemicals you are dealing with here.<br />
I have found articles where they talk about a 700% increase of LUKEMIA in adolecents!!! (sp?) WHY ARE OUR SCHOOLS FEEDING THIS DANGEROUS ADDATIVE TO OUR PRECIOUS,VULNERABLE FUTURE GENERATION!!!!!THE ONCOLOGY INDUSTRY WOULD BE LOSING ALOT OF BUSINESS&#8230;?<br />
I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT ONE OF THE (IF NOT THE)BEST GOURMET BRISKET BEEF JERKYS ON THE MARKET, CHEFS CHOICE GOURMET!<br />
IN MY RESEARCHING THIS,I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HUNDREDS OF MY CUSTOMERS AND WARN THEM OF THIS DANGER,BECAUSE 99% OF THE JERKY THAT IS ON THE STORE SHELF HAS BOTH!!!! I DEAL WITH ALOT OF STORE OWNERS AND SOME OF THEM ARE BIG JERKY &#8220;PROFIT CENTERS&#8221;.PATRICK SWAYZEE PROBABLY ATE ALOT OF JERKY&#8230;. I KNOCK DOWN ALL MY COMPETITORS WITH THIS ONE FACT. IT HAS NO PLACE IN THE HUMAN DIET! PERIOD. I AM PERSONALLY AVOIDING IT, LIFE HAS TOO MUCH TO OFFER TO END PREMATURLY BECAUSE OF THAT.<br />
                                       SINCERLY,<br />

						<p>It&#8217;s clear that some here are confusing Sodium Nitrite with Sodium Nitrate.</p>
<p>The danger is when the processed meat gets heated. The heated nitrites in the meat turns into nitrosamines, compounds which have been linked with health issues such as gastric cancer,  colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</p>

						<p>You guys are nuts. I have friends who were vegetarians and still developed colon cancer, and Chrones disease and even one with a brain tumor that died.  You cannot contribute any food to cancer. Cancer is environmental as much as it is from the foods you eat. You could live perfectly and be hit by a car. Live life to its fullest. Now please pass the bacon!!</p>

						<p>Really appreciate all the comments (some wacky, others right on the mark!) as I personally sense a need to cut back on all the &#8220;bad foods&#8221; I have been ingesting most of my life. Someone unbiased who reads this article and many others on this subject could only come up with the conclusion that getting off processed foods, especially meats, is a wise and healthy decision. Moderation is fine but choice trumps! My only problem: Will I be able to do it? Pray for me!</p>

						<p>Interesting how this rant is all about the sodium nitrite and not about the MSG.  MSG is frequently used preservative / flavor agent on the veggies at salad bars.  Seemingly eating smart (choosing the veggies over the beef) is really not very bright.  MSG is linked to other health concerns such as migraines.</p>

						<p>I agree with the everything in moderation concept. Do I think all the crap we put in food these days is bad for us? Absolutely! Am I going to turn into a neurotic nutcase that inspects everything I and my family eat? Nope. Plus, I highly doubt that this one chemical is to blame for everything they say. It&#8217;s more likely that it&#8217;s the cumulative affect of all the additives.</p>

						<p>FYI if its on the list of items that a pregnant woman shouldn&#8217;t eat that&#8217;s probably an indication that its not safe for anybody to consume unless there are other reasons behind it like producing food allergies. However, having recently gone thru pregnancy I know for sure processed meats should not be consumed because of the carcinogens, so if it harms our babies it harms us too.</p>
