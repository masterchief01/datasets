<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/huevos-rancheros/" title="huevos rancheros"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2706883279_4347250198.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="huevos rancheros" /></a></p>
I wasn&#8217;t even going to mention this dish. I&#8217;ve got no expertise in the realm of Tex-Mex cooking and generally think it&#8217;s best left to <a href="http://homesicktexan.blogspot.com/">those who know what they&#8217;re talking about</a>. Furthermore, despite the fact that I had eggs exactly this way daily when we were at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/sets/72157600108703443/">a resort in Mexico last year</a>, I suspect this isn&#8217;t the most authentic thing out there.</p>
<p>But it makes no difference because these ad-libbed and hodge-podged huevos rancheros and the smitten kitchen are at something of a standstill. They were dinner last Tuesday. They were dinner on Thursday. They were brunch today. And if this site is indeed a reflection of what goes on in our kitchen, well, then obviously it&#8217;s time to share them with you.</p>
<p>Also, because they&#8217;re awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2707703942/" title="huevos rancheros"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3249/2707703942_334d84fcd4.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="huevos rancheros" /></a>
<p>First, let me get my &#8220;semi-homemade&#8221; moment out of the way and I start by opening a can of beans, but by &#8220;beans&#8221; I mean <a href="http://www.goya.com/english/products/product.html?prodCatID=1&#038;prodSubCatID=1#6">Goya&#8217;s black bean soup</a>, and no, I don&#8217;t feel bad about it. This is my favorite-est shortcut&#8211;these guys are so perfect right out of the can&#8211;with just the right amount of liquid&#8211;I see no reason to trouble myself with cooking and seasoning my own. Or at least not when I have a quick meal in mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2706844955/" title="salsa fresca mise"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2706844955_5fe0781278.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="salsa fresca mise" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-530"></span></p>
<p>Next I make a quick <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/08/the-taco-joint-on-my-shirt/">salsa fresca</a> with diced tomatoes, some red onion, a minced jalapeno, salt and a good squeeze or two of lime juice. If you&#8217;re the cilantro type, you can mix that in as well. With tomatoes in high season right now, you&#8217;ll think you&#8217;ve died and gone to heaven.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2706852091/" title="salsa fresca"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2361/2706852091_4ebc835857.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="salsa fresca" /></a></p>
<p>Now, the egg is where this gets ugly, and I do mean that literally. This is one dish where the best taste makes for the fugliest tortilla and I suggest that you just run with it, because it&#8217;s quite simple.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2706856147/" title="corn tortillas"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2706856147_a4f2355b44.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="corn tortillas, 5.5&quot;" /></a></p>
<p>First you heat a 6-inch corn tortilla in an oiled pan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2707676016/" title="half-fry tortilla"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2707676016_f9f0b9d926.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="half-fry tortilla" /></a></p>
<p>When it is golden brown underneath, flip it over. (Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll brown it a bit more in a moment.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2707678450/" title="flip the tortilla"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3296/2707678450_a35d40611b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="flip the tortilla" /></a></p>
<p>Sprikle some shredded cheddar over the browned side and let it melt a bit. I like to use about half an ounce per tortilla.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2707681116/" title="sprinkle with cheese"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3125/2707681116_323175eecd.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="sprinkle with cheese" /></a></p>
<p>Break a single egg over the melting cheese.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2707684986/" title="add an egg"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3283/2707684986_ce9bc29111.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="add an egg" /></a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry if it rolls over the edges, that&#8217;s all part of the tasty mess of it. Season it with salt and pepper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2707688288/" title="don't worry if it rolls off"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/2707688288_3dfbd8c235.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="don't worry if it rolls off" /></a></p>
<p>When the white is about halfway set (i.e., the edges and some of the egg on the tortilla), flip the whole thing over. For me, this is when the mess always strikes as the yolk is just itching to run off the spatula as I flip it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2707696518/" title="flip the tortilla and egg together"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3014/2707696518_d587d26409.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="flip the tortilla and egg together" /></a></p>
<p>Cook it for a few minutes on the other side, flip it back onto a plate and you&#8217;re done. All there is left to do is decorate.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re Alex, that means a tidy arrangement of salsa fresca, beans, cilantro when we have it, salsa from a jar, extra and several shakes of Tabasco. For me, this means a scattered mess of salsa fresca, beans and sour cream, everything muddling together in a glorious tangle of things that are delicious&#8230;</p>
<p>Hey hon, guess what&#8217;s for dinner tomorrow?!</p>

				<p>I saw this on your flickr stream shortly before the recipe came up here, and it inspired me to make it. Except with a 10&#8243; flour tortilla, bottled salsa, and no beans. Still yummy, though!</p>

				<p>That looks yummy!</p>
<p>My shameful joy is eggs with salsa and fresh pita (a slight twist on the egg and ketchup sandwiches of my youth)  this looks so much more dignified!</p>

				<p>I stared at that tomato-esque knife for so long, trying to figure out why those cherry tomatoes looked so fake&#8230;.it&#8217;s because they were. lol.</p>

				<p>I love the technique of starting the egg on top of the tortilla. Are you able to keep it nice and over-medium, or do you end up hard-cooking the yolk? I want the hot runny yolk to mingle with the beans, so I brown my tortillas separately and cover the eggs to finish cooking separately, without a flip. But I think I&#8217;ll try the combo tortilla-egg style next time.</p>

				<p>dear deb,</p>
<p>i have been lurking on your page for months, reading and laughing and enjoying things like the crispy salted white chocolate oatmeal cookies, the lemon risotto, the blondies, etc., as well as not enjoying things like the corniest corn muffins (too desserty for my southern roots), but this, and i mean this one little thing is what prompts me to speak to you, oh kitchen goddess:</p>
<p>honestly, are those little tomatoes fake? i mean really, who are you fooling? little tomatoes just don&#8217;t look that perfect. you can tell me. i&#8217;ll still love you endlessly, in an only mildly creepy kitchen-obsessed sort of fashion. c&#8217;mon, share.</p>
<p>sincerely, pamela</p>

				<p>hmm i will have to look for black bean soup!  everything looks delicious.  am a little hesitant to use jalapenos what with the salmonella scare, i&#8217;d wash everything 3x.  but most likely i&#8217;d use that canned salsa, herdez??  not sure what the brand is, but it is decent when i&#8217;m too lazy to make salsa.</p>

				<p>Hmmm&#8230;what does it say about me that I didn&#8217;t even notice the knife?</p>
<p>Seriously killer good recipe, and simple as all get out. Sometimes, when faced with a dish like this that could be the best and easiest quick dinner imaginable, I just want to curse for marrying a man who hates eggs, and for being so respecting of it.</p>
<p>But then again, when he&#8217;s gone&#8230;&#8230;.mmmmmmmmm</p>

				<p>I am glad you all like the knife so much! I do too. It was a bridal shower gift, but it was one of those &#8220;extra&#8221; things so I never knew who gave me which gadget. There&#8217;s also a grapefruit knife with grapefruits on the handle, but I don&#8217;t use it that much. (My OXO one is way better.)</p>
<p>But this knife! It is shockingly awesome. I mean, I&#8217;m a big proponent of a good, sharp chef&#8217;s knife and I am no fan of limited-use gadgets. Don&#8217;t get me started on expensive bread knives. But when this guy even <i>looks</i> at a tomato, it splits perfectly open with no drag. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p>P.S. New Yorkers: I once saw this in a Gristedes, you know, where they have random kitchen stuff lining the aisles. I&#8217;ll look again when I go next.</p>

				<p>I make these all the time.  I start by scrambling my egg and making a pancake out of it.  Then I layer on the skillet: tortilla, black beans, egg, salsa verde, queso fresco.  YUM.  I basically use my favorite beans, salsa and cheese to make it my own.  I also let the cheese melt because that&#8217;s the kind of person I am!  :D</p>
<p>I have made more authentic versions but this is how I prefer it.</p>

				<p>My favorite breakfast!  I&#8217;m not big on breakfasty things, so this is my kind of food to eat in the morning.  We always stock up on Trader Joe&#8217;s Cuban Black Beans&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure how close the flavor is to the Goya ones, but I love having them on hand as a side dish when I make Mexican food for dinner.  And I have to say, you must also add into your repertoire: homemade tortillas.  Amazing.</p>

				<p>Disclaimer: my Mexican Grandmother was a bit of a food snob, which I inherited  ;-)</p>
<p>the proliferation of yellow cheese into mexican food is a bit too much assilimation for me&#8230;something about yellow cheese with cilantro and chili just does not work</p>
<p>a nice queso fresco would be really tasty &#8211; or even some jack cheese, and if you could find some cotija to put on top &#8211; that would make this dish sublime.</p>

Sub in the egg for any meat (but,you can add some chorizo or leftover fajitas if you like, potatos too) and add everything you would choose in a burrito, and you&#8217;ve got Huevo-R&#8217;s.

				<p>Oh. My. Gosh. Even without the amazing-looking salsa fresca (no peppers here, and my tomatoes are just coming in), and no beans or sour cream (weep), these were delicious.  Even with jarred salsa and muenster cheese (no cheddar either), I could eat these every day.  I have always wanted to make huevos rancheros, but the recipes i&#8217;ve found were intimidating. Thank you, Deb!</p>

				<p>I shall share how stupid I am now: I was staring at the photograph &#8220;salsa fresca mise&#8221; and enthralled with the colors (which is what compelled me to click over, anyway, the colors of all the photos, hello drool!) and how perfect your little grape tomatoes looked.  Absolutely enthralled.  I kept thinking &#8220;There is no way those are real!&#8221; and &#8220;Why does she have fake veggies on her cutting board?  No&#8230; they&#8217;re real, then?&#8221; and &#8220;How perfect, where the hell did she get those?&#8221; and &#8220;Why does she have little tomatoes and big ones?&#8221; finally I clicked over to your Flickr, where I see, no, they are not real (so I&#8217;m not that crazy!) and upon reading your caption, saw what I hadn&#8217;t been seeing before: the blade of the knife the fake tomatoes are attached to.</p>
<p>I am an idiot, but this sounds delicious and easy and I love huevos rancheros at brunch.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting huevos rancheros for about a week now.  Might have to be tonight.  It&#8217;s one dish that DH and I always cook together.  He&#8217;s in charge of the egg cooking, so I can&#8217;t wait to share your neat egg on the tortilla trick.  I&#8217;m in charge of the black beans, and  I use canned and cook them with some diced onion and cumin.</p>

				<p>This looks great! We Southern Cailfornians like to put the beans between the tortilla and the fried egg and use a good, white Mexican melting cheese (like Chihuahua, quesadilla or asadero) for crumbling on top. On the side, you have to have Mexican rice and oh, sliced avocados or guacamole with a few tortilla chips thrown on top for some crunch! Don&#8217;t forget that when making the fresh salsa, raw jalapenos are still on the no-no list (due to the salmonella scare) but thankfully tomatoes are now in the clear.</p>

				<p>I love Huevos Rancheros.  Mine are lazier than yours.  I fry an egg, and right after I drop the egg in the pan, I pour a little jarred salsa in (I love Whole Foods&#8217; fire-roasted salsa), put the lid on top, cook til the white is set.  I could pretty much eat that morning, noon and night. The fried egg with a little rice and black beans?  HEAVEN.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried it, I must recommend the chipotle tabasco &#8212; I want to mainline that stuff.  Eggs are a vehicle for chipotle tabasco the way fries are a vehicle for ketchup.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t usually drain the bean &#8220;soup&#8221; at all. I find it to have just the right level of soupiness straight of of the can, once mixed. Occasionally, I&#8217;ll get an extra-liquidy can and drain a tablespoon or two, but that&#8217;s rare.</p>

				<p>oooh, these look deliciously unctous and fresh and crunchy and soft all at the same time &#8211; fantastic. I am with you on the not feeling guilty part, although I don&#8217;t think we can get good canned black beans here in the UK, it&#8217;s just no something that&#8217;s very popular for some reason. I could be wrong. I&#8217;ll keep a look out. I guess making a big batch and freezing could be the answer? Do you have a good recipe or do you always use the canned?</p>

				<p>This is directly RIGHT down my alley.  I LOVE this type of food and I LOVE eggs, so this is something I would really like to make soon. I enjoy making breakfast, but sometimes I tend to make the same things (never does this happen in my dinner life, but for some reason I have my breakfast faves).  I&#8217;ll have to add this to the rotation.  That jalapeno looks absolutely perfect, too!  Thanks!</p>

<p>Random question here:  I&#8217;ve read through your archives and know that you followed Weight Watchers for a while, and I just recently started the program.  But I also know that, like me, you&#8217;re not a big fan of packaged, processed foods&#8211; which seem to feature prominently in their plan!  If you happen to have the time to answer, do you have any words of advice from your experience?  Thanks so much for your time!</p>

				<p>Hi Jennifer &#8212; I think that there is a certain temptation to lean towards packaged foods on WW because a) their nutritional and weight information is preprinted, making it easier to chart their points, and b) there are a lot of foods out there that have been hacked to make them less fatty or sugary, allowing people to better &#8220;game&#8221; the point system, so to speak. But, there&#8217;s no questioning that there are no foods with fewer points than fresh fruits and vegetables&#8211;often one point or less per cup. And then there are meals like this, that are shockingly low in points&#8211;something like 7 for the whole heaping plate up there. </p>
<p>Hm, is this something I should post about? Would anyone else be interested?</p>

				<p>this was dinner last night. i was a bit terrified about the flip, but all went well. and we had refried black beans in place of goya.<br />
i&#8217;m also trying to stick to the ww plan and definately prefer the non-prepakaged route, which makes the whole endeavor even more trying! so i&#8217;d definately be interest to read anything post regarding such topics.<br />
thanks for a tasty meal!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not a WW follower, but I have friends who are; I&#8217;d be curious about your methods. Also, if you&#8217;re looking for point count and just general nutrition info, nutritiondata.com is a good resource. You can enter your ingredients and how many servings you get out of a recipe and voila: a per serving nutrition label, customized! It&#8217;s a bit tedious to set up at first, but I find it interesting and it would at least get you an estimated point count.</p>

And I&#8217;m sure the recipe is glorious. And I&#8217;ll try it, I swear. But it&#8217;s better if I just go find the best huevos Rancheros in LA, because I&#8217;ll just torture myself otherwise.<br />

				<p>Wow.  I have de-lurked to say &#8216;thanks&#8217;!  I cooked these up for my husband and 3 and 4 year old boys last night.  They were a big hit &#8211; and easy!  I was a little apprehensive &#8211; this is defintely not something that I would typically try to sell to my kids, but I had read this post and it kept floating around in my head.  This is defintely going to be a go-to dish when I am trying to get a simple supper on the table quickly.   </p>
<p>We made a quick salsa with cilantro, tomatoes, onions and lime juice, salt and cumin.  Then I let the boys top the tortilla/eggs with black olives, sour cream, cheese, and the bean soup (great tip by the way!).  I am not sure if they just liked all the toppings, or the actual dish, but it was a hit either way.  Thanks!!!</p>

				<p>This is my standard three-days-til-payday meal.  Well, everything but the homemade salsa.  When I&#8217;m trying to stretch a dollar, fresh tomatoes are so not on the menu!  But the jarred stuff from Trader Joes is good in a pinch.  And don&#8217;t worry, I eat it three or four nights in a row, easy.</p>

				<p>I just had this for dinner two nights in a row &#8211; so quick, easy, and cheap and sooo fresh and tasty if you make the salsa!  This went over really well with my husband.  Great tip on the soup &#8211; even better than the refried black beans I usually get.  And for those using flour tortillas (my grocery store was out of corn), it&#8217;s easier if you heat it up on lower heat for longer &#8211; that way, it won&#8217;t puff up, then flip, add the egg (and cheese if you&#8217;re adding cheese), and turn up the heat some.  That worked out really well &#8211; the tortilla got nice and crispy without air bubbles that make the egg slide right off.</p>

				<p>Try frying the tortillas in some lard.  Corn tortillas fried in lard are like nothing else.  This I promise you.  We have a brand of salsa here called Salsa Lisa, it&#8217;s a fresh salsa that&#8217;s great but exponentially better when you fry it in a pan with a wee bit of olive oil and then poach/fry the egg in that, pour the whole hot mess on the crispy tortilla, top with some queso,  this is how we do for huevos.</p>

				<p>I was afraid the tortilla would burn before the egg cooked enough to flip it, but apparently that isn&#8217;t a problem?  I usually just scramble an egg with cheese, roll it up in a warm flour tortilla with salsa, but your version is a lot classier!</p>

<p>I just googled &#8220;tomato slicing knife&#8221; and your little gem popped up on a site called Gourmac for $3.49!  I&#8217;m ordering one for myself and a few more for gifts.</p>

				<p>This is the third recipe from this site (combined with hours of awed ogling and the occasional delighted giggle), and I have not once been disappointed!  So yummy!  I left out the jalapeno, because I didn&#8217;t have one, but mixed in some chili oil and corn.  My lovah was appropriately impressed and drenched in deliciousness.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m trying this recipe this week.  If you like Tex-Mex, you should try Tyler Florence&#8217;s recipe for Braised Pork Tacos on foodnetwork.com.  I promise, you will be bowled over.  They are incredibly delicious and easy (with purchased corn tortillas, though).  Probably in the top three tacos I&#8217;ve ever had.  Make sure you add plenty of braising liquid to the shredded meat for flavor and moistness.</p>

				<p>Am I the only one who found this technique hard to master? My tortilla got soaked in oil on one. On another, I lost half the egg when I scooped the thing off the pan. On another, the egg slid right off the tortilla and on to the pan. I also had trouble getting the egg cooked all the way with it being on top of the tortilla. And there seemed no way to flip it without breaking the yolk. Also, the beans were good, but they seemed too soupy to me, and they contained MSG. Sorry to be a downer here, but it seems a lot easier to me to fry the eggs separately, then put them on top of a toasted tortilla.</p>

				<p>My husband is working late tonight and the baby is asleep, so I thought I&#8217;d whip this up for my dinner and HOLY COW!!! I&#8217;ve found a new favorite. This was so easy and so delicious &#8211; what a fabulous idea. I just sat there alone (ahhhh&#8230;.solitude), enjoying every bite, just freaking out. BTW, I used a flour tortilla (I didn&#8217;t have any corn ones on hand) and as long as the heat was low, it was fine. In fact, it turned out all perfectly crispy. Anyway, I had no one to share this with at the moment, so I might as well, just send out a big thanks for sharing.</p>

				<p>Mmmmmm yum.  I eat so much of these that it really no longer remains in the realm of the funny.  :D  Another thing you can do if you&#8217;re having trouble making the ingredients &#8217;stay&#8217; is pop everything, all put together, into the oven (except for things like sour cream, tomatoes, fresh stuff), and let them get all melty and browned, and then put the eggs on top once they come out.  That is my own personal sneaky and quick method.</p>

				<p>Deb, thanks for inspiring us to cook!  The photography on this site is amazing and makes me super hungry after browsing.  As soon as I saw this post, I jotted down the ingredients and made it for a weeknight dinner for my husband.  He LOVED it&#8230; thank you so much!  </p>
<p>I saw an earlier comment on preparing low-piont meals for people who are on the weight-watcher&#8217;s diet.  I think it&#8217;s such a great idea since I am watching more of what I eat and have been told by my doctor to stop eating processed foods &#8211; but its so hard between a full-time job, working out, cooking, etc.  Also, maybe some low-calorie low-point desserts would be a great idea as well.  Your desserts are to die for.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the post&#8211;these were amazing! Though admittedly I did have an awfully tough time with the flip&#8212;any advice on getting the egg to stay on the tortilla? Mine all wanted to run immediately off :) Have you ever tried this with just egg whites? I also experimented with that and ended up with a big (DELICIOUS) mess. Part of the problem might have been my base&#8211;I blended up black beans with garlic, serrano chiles, red onion, and lime juice and spread that on the tortilla as it began to cook. Again&#8211;amazing flavors, just messy.</p>

				<p>These are amazing! I threw a few together for dinner tonight and we loved them. I couldn&#8217;t believe how quickly they went together. I didn&#8217;t have trouble with them. We like our eggs hard so if the yolk broke, it wasn&#8217;t a problem for us. I found it easier to flip if I cooked it a bit longer on a lower temperature before trying to flip it. I can see that now that school is starting up, this will be a regular on our menu!</p>

				<p>Thank you for the yummy and oh-so-easy recipe!  I have made this twice in the last 2 weeks!!  You mentioned your yolks are itching to run off the tortilla when you flip them&#8230;  When I sprinkled the cheese on my tortilla before adding the egg, I sprinkled the cheese in a donut/ring shape leaving the very center bare.  This is where I added the egg, and the yolk nestles right into the center and stays put!!!  Thanks again for so many wonderful recipes!!  You rock.  :-)</p>

				<p>I was steered here by a Wausau, Wisconsin newspaper reporter who posted your recipe on one of his blogs. I always have huevos rancheros when I go out to California for work trips. But I had never made them before. I took your recipe and tweaked it a bit (didn&#8217;t fry the egg on top of the tortilla), used a combo of cheddar and monterey jack cheese and used bottled salsa, plus added chopped avocado to the mix. I invited friends over and told (warned) them this was my first attempt at making huevos rancheros. Well, needless to say, they were to die for! Not only did we have them for supper, but I had them for lunch the next day and breakfast the following day.</p>
<p>Huevos Rancheros&#8230;not just for breakfast anymore! Thanks for sharing.</p>
<p>PS. I have bookmarked your site.</p>

				<p>Just saw your twitter post and came here right away! Yum! With my peppers and tomatoes finally ripening out in the garden, it&#8217;s time to make some fresh salsa and give this a go. I&#8217;ve never made this dish before, just never gave it much thought. Like you, I&#8217;m not a tex-mex cook&#8230;rather leave it to the experts. But, gee, I have all those ingredients (some are just staples in my kitchen), to why not?! Thanks for sharing. I think this would make a great dinner tonite!</p>

				<p>LOVE IT! Like many before me, this was the first time I cooked the egg of top of the tortilla and it turned out so fabulous that it made me question why I had never thought of it before. Growing up, my dad had also put red enchilada sauce on our Huevos Rancheros. The black beans and salsa were more my style! My only regret was that I didn&#8217;t have any of my homemade salsa to put on top, the salsa verde I had on hand worked well enough.</p>

Added a side of homemade baked beans and I think we have found a new &#8220;fast food&#8221; dinner.  Thanks for the great idea!</p>

				<p>I love the use of &#8220;fugliest&#8221; in this article.  These buggers are hard to flip&#8230; the last one I made was perfect and got loud cheers from the husband and I.  I don&#8217;t like eggs all that much, but I love these!</p>

				<p>Black bean soup from Goya is one of the best creations, ever. I don&#8217;t think many people have it as soup though. My Cuban future mother-in-law cooks rice in the soup (and maybe a bit of water or oil) as a great and ridiculously easy side dish for just about any meal.</p>

				<p>Delicious and fun!  These are so enjoyable and easy to make.  I think these huevos rancheros would be wonderful to cook as a group with a friends.  I used canned cooked black beans and heated them up in a small sauce pan. I also added in a yummy sliced avocado for topping.  Definitely messy and the pre-garnished result is a bit ugly, but oh so worth it.  Consider substituting plain yogurt for sour cream.  (I&#8217;ve found plain Greek yogurt to be a perfect replacement for sour cream.)  I also think these would fair very well with a small whole wheat tortilla instead of corn tortilla.  It took a few tries to get the egg just right: not too hard, not too runny, but still yummy regardless.  The salsa fresca was just perfect and fresh.  Thank you for this scrumptious recipe, Smitten Kitchen!</p>

				<p>It is very important to notice this are Texmex &#8220;Huevos Rancheros&#8221; there are sevral types of Huevos Rancheros in Mexico, and I can Asure you they are not only very popular, very very good. But the truth is that they are very diferent frome the ones in this recipie.</p>
<p>Huevo Ranchero is a Fried Egg over a Fried Corn Tortilla, and  covered with a good Huevos Ranchero is a Fried Egg over a Fried Corn Tortilla, and covered with a good Hot cooked Salsa.<br />
The Salsa is usually made but not forcefully by firing Tomatoes with Onions Serrano Chiles and Cilantro.<br />
You can also use Gren Salsa, or Mole which is a grate result.</p>

				<p>Loved your take on Huevos Rancheros!<br />
Other than the cheddar cheese,  it&#8217;s a very Mexican egg dish I could have come up with any time! Mexican Manchego or Oaxaca cheese would make it more &#8220;authentic&#8221;, but hey!<br />
Just PLEASE, when naming your dish, always remember that the &#8220;H&#8221; is mute. It&#8217;s more like &#8220;Oueh-vos&#8221; than &#8220;Jouei-vos&#8221;<br />
Same applies to &#8220;Habanero&#8221;, BTW&#8230;. and it&#8217;s habanero as in Havana, not Haba&#8221;gn&#8221;ero&#8230; please guys!!!</p>

				<p>Can&#8217;t go wrong with tortillas, eggs, tomatoes, jalapenos and cilantro! But I&#8217;m confused about the black bean soup. You just scoop it out of the can and eat it cold? It isn&#8217;t soupy? I am tempted to substitute in some fresh guacamole instead!! I love your casual, homey, easy approach to food. Many thanks.</p>

				<p>I love this site, adore the postings and I am considering becoming a site lurker myself. I am making Huevos Rancheros tonight and this is the best recipe I have come across. As for the Goya black bean soup, it is a life saver. My in laws came last weekend. My father in law is from Bayamon Puerto Rico. I quickly tossed 3 cans in pot, added heaping teaspoons of home made soffrito (oilive oil, garlic, cilantro,peppers, onions etc) I added a wee bit of water, mostly to rinse the cans. I keep calabazzo  in the freezer. Its the pumpkin puerto ricans out in thier beans for flavor. I sliced off a few  slivers and tossed it in. this took 5 minutes total. I hid the cans and served lol His father was raving about the food, priceless. He is quite opinionated so it was fun. I am not spanish btw. The same is true for the  pinto beans in sauce.  I&#8217;ll let ya know how the Huevos rancheros turned out!!</p>

				<p>PS  since I am here and see a few doing WW I thought I would offer this alternative to tortillas. I bought these wraps at BJ&#8217;s, they have them at Costcos also. The weeks that my husband and I eat them for at least 2 meals we always double our weight loss, even when we arent even trying. They are called Whole wheat Roll up, it has a picture of a tape measure around the wrap. It has 10 net carbs  110 calories 7 grams of fiber and 10 protiens per wrap. They taste incredible and you really cant eat more than one. You can use them for panini, pizza crusts, wraps etc so we are going to replace the tortilla in the huevos rancheros tonight.  Damascus Bakery is the  maker of the &#8220;Roll Up&#8221;</p>

<p>I made these for dinner last night and blogged about them this morning&#8211;though your photos are far superior to mine!  I made a few tiny changes to the Salsa Fresca, but otherwise followed your recipe exactly.  The Goya black bean soup is fantastic!  Thanks!!</p>

				<p>I use this method regularly for eggs, often just with flour tortillas, pre-shredded cheddar, and jarred salsa (still very, very tasty!).  For those having &#8220;technical difficulties&#8221;, here are my suggestions, at least for flour tortillas:</p>
<p>A couple minutes is all that&#8217;s needed on the first heating of the first side&#8230;just make sure your pan has heated up all the way (on my stove it&#8217;s over solid medium heat), or your tortilla will absorb too much oil and get soggy on that side.  Flip.</p>
<p>On the other side, I follow Deb&#8217;s instructions and crack the egg when the cheese is just starting to melt.  Once the egg is cracked, i swirl the pan a bit to spread it out and let some of the white drip over the sides to anchor it.  Then &#8211; and here&#8217;s where I differ &#8211; I cover the pan for a minute or so, which helps the egg set a little bit before the flip (it&#8217;s not going to cook through or anything, but it gets it a touch past &#8220;goo&#8221;).</p>
<p>Once I flip, I turn the heat off, but keep the pan on the burner.  Three minutes or so on the unheated pan gets the whites set, the yolk runny, and doesn&#8217;t cause the eggs or cheese to brown (which was a problem for me initially).</p>

				<p>I always love your recipes, but I must share how to make it more authentic to Mexican cooking. My husband is Mexican and when I made this for him, he told me that you do not use salsa, you use enchilada sauce. The next time I made it, I used his suggestion, and oh my, was he right! You add the enchilada sauce into the pan about a minute before removing and it cooks nicely and adds a slight softness to the crispy corn tortilla. Tasted just like eating a fonda.</p>

				<p>My husband had a tip for helping to keep the egg from making a mess on the flip.  He added a small &#8220;moat&#8221; of cheese around the edge of the tortilla to hold it in.  It gets melty then crispy but is pretty delicious if one has a taste for fried cheese (YUM).  This recipe is awesome.</p>

				<p>Hi-<br />
I just started looking at this site.  I live in the San Luis Valley in Colorado.  While this dish looks tasty, it is not what we call Huevos Rancheros around here.  Here, we use homemade green chili to top a couple of eggs inside of a flour tortilla. Serve it with crispy has browns with green chili and cheese on it as well.  It will stick to your ribs and make your mouth water.  (I have to use my own green chili- hot and lots of flavor- and now my mouth is watering!)</p>

It was AMAZING &#8211; I have found my go-to recipe for huevos rancheros!  Thanks for the tip on the goya bean soup.  I also bought pre-made salsa fresca since I needed this to be extra-quick.  I&#8217;ll definitely be making this again.</p>

				<p>I had a little trouble with this, but I&#8217;m a cooking newbie and can&#8217;t flip a fried egg to save my life, so maybe practice makes perfect. The main problem I had with the first round (I was just cooking for myself thank GOD) was that I put the heat too high, so trying to cook the egg from underneath was burning the tortilla. The pan was smoking and it was a big mess. The second time went a little smoother, with a very low flame. Still couldn&#8217;t get the yolk to stay together upon flipping, but I&#8217;ll get it eventually!</p>

				<p>Delicious. I&#8217;ve made this several times. I like to add spice to my black beans and a bit of jalapeno salsa (canned). It adds a bit of flare. Its a balancing act to keep the egg in the middle, but I find using a smaller pan and a small tortilla shell makes it easiest. The homemade salsa is the best, extra lime juice, extra cilantro, extra jalapenos!! Yum.</p>

				<p>Hello Deb, thanks for a fabulous new twist on a fried egg.  After reading your blog for so long I feel like I should have tuned in to this recipe long ago, but it all clicked! today &amp; thank goodness, better late than never.  Husband doesn&#8217;t even like fried eggs, but I broke the yolk which I believe makes it easier to flip too, &amp; voila he&#8217;s sold!  It was great with fresh tomatoes &amp; green onions drizzed in extra virg olive oil. Also made your Zucchini Bread this morning.  Going to a get-together later with it so all I can say so far is it looks good with a nice gentle rise, &amp; smells good &amp; wholesome.  Congrats also on keeping up your witty &amp; creative blog during motherhood,<br />

				<p>I made your version of these this morning to rave reviews.   The flipping of the tortilla got better as I went along, but it was a wee bit tricky!  These are delicious and so filling with all the accompaning condiments and some chorizo sausage (that I chopped into the scrambled egg mixture that I used to top mine).  The only additional I&#8217;ll make next time is to heat and add some corn.  I bought, as a trial, a microwave pkg of seasoned black beans that made just enough for the four of us for this.  A little corn garnish would have made it perfect.  So glad I tried this and will make it again.  So fun!</p>

				<p>Since a friend referred me to your blog a couple months ago, my husband and I have made this dish almost weekly. One of the best takeaways: only Goya black beans for us from now on! Plus, this time of year (September in Ohio), we utilize our garden tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions (with a must-have addition of avocado) for the perfect salsa fresca accompaniment. Thank you for a simple and delicious dinner idea for those days when we both get home way too late from work and take out holds zero appeal.</p>

				<p>I never would have thought to make these, &#8217;cause really, eggs plus salsa???  But I came across this recipe and it looked simple, so I figured what the heck.  And y&#8217;know, they&#8217;re actually pretty good.  You wouldn&#8217;t think eggs and Mexican would work, but here, it sorta does.  Plus, thanks for turning me onto that black bean &#8220;soup&#8221; &#8212; I never would have given that a second glance in the store, &#8217;cause it says soup, but apparently, they lie, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s not soup at all, just delicious beans with no work.  Yay! :)</p>

				<p>My fiance and I were stoked to try this recipe. It looks so delicious and really we like anything Mexican inspired. It was a little tricky getting the hang of the timing and adjusting the heat on our range. We got the last half to turn out alright once we got it down. Though they were pretty ugly but delicious. Though neither of us are huge egg fans, so I have a feeling that next time we might just fry the tortillas with cheese and add the toppings and skip the eggs. (I know not so much &#8220;Huevos Rancheros&#8221; then, but  hey this got us out of our beef burrito rut so thank you!)</p>

				<p>I am an enormous fan of your site. Hard to pick a favorite among the 40 or so recipes I have tried of yours but this one is high up there. We add a tomatilla salsa from Frontera, and after the egg/tortilla is done we fry a banana just until slightly brown. It adds such a nice bit of sweet to balance out all the savory. Yum. Thank you again. Even my 3 year old twins ate every bite.</p>

				<p>My oh my!  While reading this week&#8217;s delight (corn tacos, which I do not have the ingredients to make), I was sent to this page.  Why oh why haven&#8217;t I ever made these?  They are fantastic!  I&#8217;m making a mental note to freeze my home made black bean soup leftovers in small portions so I can enjoy these at will and without any guilt (the whole $1.99 for a small can? MSG? line of thinking).</p>

				<p>Of all the recipes on your site, I think this is the one that I make most often. It makes a quick, easy, pretty healthy dinner that I fall back on quite a bit. But I never seem to get tired of it! So glad you share this &#8211; even if it isn&#8217;t the prettiest thing in the world, it&#8217;s delicious and such a useful recipe!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!  Where do you find the Goya black bean soup?  I&#8217;ve looked for it in quite a few grocery stores with no luck.  I&#8217;ve been mixing black beans with refried to get a better consistency than just plain old beans, but it makes a lot and almost always goes to waste.  Which drives me bonkers!</p>

				<p>Just made this tonight with fresh corn on the cob that I cut off the cob, oh my gosh it was so good!</p>
<p>Maggie- I haven&#8217;t looked for the GOYA soup but here&#8217;s what I do: one can of black beans (low sodium) dump a good bit of the liquid. You may want to reserve the liquid to adjust consistency later. Heat beans and add seasonings. Using a pastry cutter or potato masher mash the beans a bit to break up about half of them. As thye heat up the mashed beans will help thicken the rest. Add liquid if needed to thin to desired consistency. Voila!</p>

				<p>Maggie &#8212; I usually find them right next to the Goya regular beans, except the can is red instead of blue. But, your store also might keep it by the canned soups.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve done Huevos many times before, but never with the egg cooked with the tortilla method, so was inspired to try this. It being foggy and grey and Decembery around here, and no decent tomatoes to be found, I had to make some adjustments, but turned out really tasty.  Used a regular can of black beans and added a bit of tomato sauce, a tiny bit of chipotle, garlic, cumin, oregano, AND&#8230;some chopped roasted sweet potatoes I had leftover. Only thing missing was some sliced avocado&#8230;next time.  The flip thing wasn&#8217;t at all messy doing it on a griddle.</p>

				<p>Made this tonight and added lettuce on top to make it more dinner-y.  It was absolutely delicious and didn&#8217;t need to change a thing (except to add a teensy bit of bacon on the side).  Also plated up surprisingly pretty.</p>
