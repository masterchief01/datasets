<p>I have spent the last few months unearthing recipes I&#8217;ve had bookmarked for an eternity. A whole lot of them, mostly things I have spared you, did not exactly age like fine wine, as they say; fillings ran, vegetables never caramelized, spiced mixed nuts were grimy and cookies were painfully sweet. The rest of them, however, caused me to become consumed with regret when I think of all of the times we could have already consumed <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/12/ridiculously-easy-butterscotch-sauce/">mindblowing butterscotch</a>, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/12/creamed-mushrooms-on-chive-butter-toast/">caviar-esque creamed mushrooms</a> and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/12/cream-biscuits/">speedy, rich biscuits</a> but did not know of them yet. This is one of those times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4201749654/" title="egging up the casserole"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2556/4201749654_085527b036.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="egging up the casserole" /></a></p>
<p>As I mentioned yesterday, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/12/how-to-host-brunch-and-still-sleep-in/">I&#8217;m all about hosting brunch, but only if I can make everything in advance</a>. When it comes to <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/05/my-bacon-is-always-crisp/">biscuits</a>, bacon, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/new-years-day-2001/">baked French toast</a> and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/winter-fruit-salad/">fruit salads</a>, pulling it off is obvious. But I always get lost on the eggs, and for a whole lot of people, it&#8217;s not breakfast if it doesn&#8217;t involve eggs. This strata &#8212; really, a savory bread pudding &#8212; is the missing piece because not only can you make it the night before, you are supposed to.</p>

<p><span id="more-5440"></span></p>
<p>You can even, as we did this weekend, run out to pick up eggs and milk at the store, your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4200996531/">bacon from the Polish meat market</a>, coffee that someone else made for you, and assemble it while waiting impatiently for the snowstorm to start.</p>

<p>Then, once it really starts to come down, wrap it in plastic and chill it in the fridge while you go investigate the wonderland.</p>

<p>And the next morning, when everything outside your kitchen window is blanketed white, wet and icy, bake it up, stay inside and watch Home Alone while eating the most effortlessly decadent eggs yet.</p>

				<p>When I saw that you were doing easy brunch dishes, I hoped you&#8217;d include a make-ahead strata.  Yours is very similar to our family favorite, the Grand Central Strata (posted via Amazon <a>here</a>).  The two key ingredients&#8230; sourdough bread, which is dotted on the top with butter before baking.  It&#8217;s like eating a slice of puffed buttered toast atop an already-wonderful savory pudding.  Love it.</p>
<p>Thanks for this site, by the way.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve commented before, but I&#8217;ve enjoyed it for a long time.</p>

				<p>You are truly an inspiring person, Deb.  Not only are your recipes laced with yummy ingredients and mouthwatering taste (that is actually palatable through the screen!), but you also add so much good warmth, cheer and rhetorical *spice* to the posts, it has me coming back everyday for more.  Thank you for taking the time to share all of this with your readers . . . and, I can&#8217;t wait to try this strata!  I might just have to lick my screen, maybe I&#8217;ll get a quick taste?  :)</p>

				<p>The photos of the snow are beautiful! It&#8217;s more or less warm here in Israel, but how nice to know that somewhere it&#8217;s snowing in December! I&#8217;m thinking of making this for a dinner soon &#8211; breakfast for dinner sounds especially good right now.</p>

				<p>There was something about that storm that lent itself to spinach and cheese. I ended up stuffing those ingredients (though my cheese of choice was feta) into mushrooms and serving it up at a cocktail party for guest who still had functioning subway lines. Now I have a recipe in case during the next snow party, guests get stranded and I must feed them in the morning!</p>

				<p>Just like Amber posted before me, I have also made this amazing strata. I happened to have a bunch of fresh spinach in my fridge, so I sauteed that (with a little garlic, tee hee), instead of using frozen spinach. All of my guests had seconds, and all requested the recipe. Oh, now I&#8217;m getting hungry&#8230;</p>

				<p>This is my FAVORITE strata recipe, and I&#8217;ve tried quite a few over the years. :-)  I don&#8217;t like mine quite as &#8220;custardy&#8221; though, so I add an additional package of spinach and 12-16 oz of bread.  </p>
<p>I agree that it&#8217;s a perfect make ahead brunch food.  Really, this and a fruit salad and coffee cake and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>

				<p>Interesting with the pieces of bread on top to be crusty.  My MIL always made it with cubes of de-crusted bread held down by a big layer of cheese across the top, so the bread was always kind of gloppy.  I think I would like this a lot better; it seems like it would still have some chew.</p>

				<p>Stratas are the best for just the reason you mention &#8212; no last-minute maneuvers. I made the one in the big Silver Palate (with gorgonzola and pancetta) for a friend&#8217;s 50th birthday brunch. Yours sounds super &#8212; a perfect Christmas or New Year&#8217;s (or any day&#8217;s) breakfast. I&#8217;m taking a copy with me to the country.</p>
<p>Hope you have the best Christmas ever with your adorable addition.</p>

				<p>My dad has been making this at Christmas (and whenever else I beg) pretty much since the day it appeared in Gourmet. In fact, he still has the old pages from the magazine that he ripped out. It is one of my favorite things on earth and I&#8217;m so glad you are highlighting it this year. Thank you for shedding light on such an amazing dish.</p>
<p>*Pst* You can also do it with ridiculous amounts of cheese and cubed ham and it&#8217;s equally to die for. </p>

				<p>Ah, heaven! I will have to try this strata. Also, people reading this post, the &#8220;one year ago&#8221; braised beef short ribs recipe is fantastic. Just did it this weekend and marveled at the tenderness of the meat, the flavor of the sauce, and the aroma of my condo. I&#8217;m not a beef person but this, this is IT. Didn&#8217;t even need the horseradish sauce, although I&#8217;d probably be tip-toppling over nirvana if I had made that too.</p>

I usually have more bread cubes than will fit in my baking dish, so I put the overflow in a second small kids&#8217; dish without spinach (more spinach for the grownups) for the anti-green among us. Mmmm&#8230;I love this recipe.</p>

				<p>Sorry, I&#8217;m a total dunce &#8212; so you layer 1/3 of the bread cubes and then put another 1/3 of the bread cubes straight on top? Or is the order of the layering mixed up? I imagine you&#8217;d do a layer of the spinach layer, but I guess it&#8217;d make sense to have a really hearty base. Help. I&#8217;ve clearly over-thought this (really, really unnecessarily, I&#8217;m sure.)</p>

				<p>How do you get all the moisture out of the spinach? I use a sieve and press the water out, then I&#8217;ve tried squeezing it in paper towels (and they split) and I&#8217;ve even tried a kitchen towel but the spinach stuck to it. Do you have a technique that works for you?</p>

				<p>Great recipe! I always struggle with the measurements of bread.  I usually try to make my own, but a 2lb loaf (from my bread machine) may or may not equal 8 cups.  Which would be the better to use for measuring? Volume vs weight?</p>

				<p>What, <a href="mailto:Gaelle@whatareyoufeedingyourkidsthesedays.com">Gaelle@whatareyoufeedingyourkidsthesedays.com</a>, you&#8217;ve never had bread pudding?  It&#8217;s bread in a baked dish, and it&#8217;s delicious.  Think of this dish as a savory strata.  I have a similar strata recipe that has served me well as a potluck brunch dish for many years, and I can&#8217;t wait to try Deb&#8217;s recipe.</p>

				<p>Lisa &#8212; I use one of three. I either squeeze small fistfuls to get as much water out as possible. I press it around in a colander with a spoon to squeeze the water out. But my favorite method, and the hands-down easiest, is twisting it up in cheesecloth. It really gets water out with minimal effort.</p>

I love it, and I have made it so many times that now I get requests like, &#8220;Hey Jess, make your spinach egg thing for tomorrow&#8217;s meeting/brunch/post-holiday breakfast.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve used a few different cheese combos, but my favorite way is just like the original recipe, with Gruyère and parm.</p>

				<p>I was wondering if you knew about this strata when I read your brunch post. I have been making it for years, usually with two packages of spinach and a bit more onion. I also layer it in halfs instead of thirds which is faster but just as good. Last time I used extra-old white cheddar instead of the gruyère. Delicious! It gets requested by my guest every time I host brunch. Great pics!</p>

				<p>I made a variation of this for dinner tonight.  I used pumpernickel bread, a mix of caramelized onions and shredded brussel sprouts instead of spinach, and subbed aged cheddar for gruyere (and a few other changes as well).  It was good.

				<p>Have very fond memories of a very decadent and creamy, sausage and cheese strata that my mom used to make every year to eat on Christmas morning.<br />
I&#8217;m bookmarking this version and as I sit here staring at the enormous pile of fresh spinach I bought at the market yesterday, think I&#8217;ll have to try it.  </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m off to do a search for the equivalent of fresh spinach for a 10 oz. box of frozen.  Merci for the inspiration!</p>

				<p>I came across this recipe over the summer and loved it!  Yours looks delicious!  I used leeks instead of the onion and added baby bella mushrooms.  I also found a delicious Cheddar Jalapeno bread at the union square farmers market to use- so I used cheddar and pepper jack cheeses instead.  It was so easy to make the day before and bake the day of.  </p>
<p>I love your pictures of the city and your baby is just adorable:)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fan of a tasty strata on Christmas morning. Just wake up, start the oven, then throw the strata in the oven, start the hot buttered rums and cocoa (or coffee), and let the presents begin! We&#8217;ve even come to calling it &#8220;Christmas Morning Casserole.&#8221; This looks delicious, and I will be trying it out THIS Christmas. Simply marvelous&#8230;Happy Holidays to all!</p>

				<p>I am NOT a cook and that is why I married a chef. But I did feel like I could make this dish, so I made it last night and added bacon and kale. Haven&#8217;t tasted it yet &#8212; and I&#8217;m hoping my visiting in-laws baked it properly&#8230;</p>

				<p>Long time lurker here who has cooked many of your recipes. I LOVE to read your blog and recreate your delights!! So I would really like to make this, but don&#8217;t need so much. Does anyone think this would work OK if i cut the recipe in half&#8230;and if so, what size baking dish to use??  Also,the recipe says to add the spinach mixture on top of the bread, but as far as a I can tell that is really just the spinach&#8230;I don&#8217;t see where anything is mixed into it&#8230;maybe I&#8217;m missing something. Might have to skip the Dijon too&#8230;don&#8217;t think we have any&#8230;hmmm.</p>

				<p>Amy Cooks&#8212;Yes, I&#8217;ve halved this successfully, usually in an 8&#8243;x8&#8243; pyrex.  But you really might want the full recipe.  It reheats beautifully, and it&#8217;s so good, you might find out you eat more than you planned!  :-)  </p>
<p>And the spinach mixture is the spinach mixed with the cooked onions and spices.  If you don&#8217;t have dijon, do you have another mustard?  I think it really helps.</p>

				<p>Hey Daria&#8230;.Thanks for the info! I will probably stick with the half recipe, at least this time. I have one other thing to bake tomorrow, and don&#8217;t think i&#8217;d have enough eggs if I make the whole thing. We do have some yellow mustard and some Spicy Pear Ginger Mustard, I think it is? Will also be using swiss instead of gruyere, since I couldn&#8217;t get to the one store I know of around here that has it!! So yeah, I&#8217;ll let you know how my version of this delicious looking creation turns out!</p>

				<p>So I&#8217;m bringing breakfast over to my parents&#8217; house tomorrow for Christmas.  I called and told my dad that I was making this strata (which looks SOOO good) and he asks &#8220;what kind of sausage is in it?&#8221; I reply &#8220;there is no sausage in it.  No meat at all.&#8221;  Silence.  &#8220;Disappointing,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I would have expected this from my wife, but not from you&#8230;. my FAVORITE DAUGHTER.&#8221;  Silence.  &#8220;Not everything has to have meat in it.  You can have bacon on the side,&#8221; I say.  Anyways, hope he&#8217;ll appreciate it even if it is &#8220;meat free.&#8221;  Plus, I made cinnamon rolls with an orange glaze frosting.  It&#8217;s going to be perfect!</p>

				<p>Thanks for this recipe &#8212; turned out great for our Christmas Eve brunch. I used a 1-lb bag of spinach, a little more bread, and a lot more nutmeg. It was my first time grating a fresh nutmeg and I thought it would be a lot more work to grate the 1/4 tsp. I probably doubled it. What a nice flavor &#8212; so different than reg nutmeg.</p>
<p>Everyone loved the strata, even the picky ones. It&#8217;s a keeper, and the make-ahead part is wonderful. I have to see if you have a make-ahead tag, and see what else you&#8217;ve come up with. </p>
<p>Thank you! Have a lovely Christmas. Such a sweet time in your life!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m making this for Christmas breakfast :)  &#8230;I was short a couple eggs and some space in my dish (although I checked and it said 3 quarts!) so it&#8217;s only 2 layers&#8230;hopefully it will turn out okay.  If not, I plan to make this early enough to erase all traces of failure :P</p>

				<p>#80 Lenore:</p>
<p>(I work in the cheese dept. at Whole Foods)</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like gruyere, I think you could successfully use fontina.  There are two versions: the &#8220;real&#8221; one &#8211; Fontina val D&#8217;aosta, which has a stronger flavor, but definitely not anything like Gruyere.  I&#8217;ve seen it paired up with spinach fairly often.  There&#8217;s also a younger version called Fontal, which has a milder, less in-your-face flavor.  A mix of the two, would probably be just right.  Also, you could use Asiago Fresco, which is a young, soft version of the grating Asiago we&#8217;re all more familiar with.</p>

I&#8217;ve been lurking on your blog for quite some time, but this dish was just so tasty, I needed to thank you! Happy New Year &amp; congrats on your cute baby boy.</p>

				<p>I made this for Christmas morning breakfast today, it was SUBLIME. I added a roll of good quality pork sausage for my He-Man, otherwise he might&#8217;ve revolted (I omitted the salt in the spinach mixture since sausage is so salty). Oh, I also thought it seemed too dry (probably due to the addition of the sausage)when I was assembling, so I added another 6 eggs with some more mustard and pepper. IT WAS PERFECT, a 10 out of 10!!!</p>

				<p>Deb-<br />
This looks great; I was wondering if you have ever tried freezing a prepared strata?  Could I freeze it before baking and then just put it in the oven another time if I know guests are coming over?</p>

				<p>This made for a wonderful Christmas brunch, along side a tasty fruit salad. I cut the recipe in half, used swiss in place of gruyere, found a recipe online to make my own substitute for Dijon and threw in a few leeks&#8230;it was GREAT. Just like every recipe I make from this website!</p>

				<p>Delurking &#8211; I am a fairly inexperienced cook, so your website is very appealling!</p>
<p>A few questions: why do you need to let it sit overnight?  What would it be like if you cooked it right away, or after an hour?  I don&#8217;t think there will be any leftovers, but&#8230; can you freeze eggy things like this or quiche?  Or would they get weird?</p>

				<p>Made this for Christmas morning and it was absolutely delicious!  I can see where the changes and or additions would work well but it was perfect as is!  It beat the heck out of having to fix a nice breakfast Christmas morning when all I want to do is enjoy the morning sitting around with my coffee.  I fixed it as I finished my other cooking/baking Christmas Eve and it was so nice to wake up, put in oven and then just serve and enjoy!</p>

				<p>munichalli &#8212; Sitting overnight allows the bread to absorb the egg custard. If you bake it sooner, the pieces will just taste like toasted bread. I haven&#8217;t tried to freeze this before.</p>

				<p>I too would like to know how to measure the bread.  I only had a 2.5 quart casserole dish and I had way too much bread for that.  I didn&#8217;t know if I should cube it and smash it into a measuring cup, gently drop the cubes into measuring cup till it was full, or what :)  It came out great I must say.  Love your stuff Deb.</p>

				<p>Newbie &#8212; I started with a half-pound loaf of Italian bread. If your dish is a little small, I&#8217;d leave out <i>a little</i> of the bread and <i>a little</i> of the custard.</p>

				<p>This was wonderful&#8211;and even made my veggie-hating dad love spinach!  I accidentally forgot the cheese, so I sprinkled some parmesan on top halfway through the cooking, and it still was delicious.  We served it with homemade applesauce that was in the freezer from apple-picking days, and it was a hit.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the recipe&#8211;sure beats the egg casserole I used to make!</p>

				<p>Made this for Christmas morning and it was DELICIOUS! HOWEVER, I&#8217;m still confused about the quantity of bread that this is meant for. My 1/2 lb. Italian loaf from Fresh Direct was only about 4 loose cups of bread cubes. I used a package of frozen spinach, 1/2 the cheese, 5 eggs and 1/2 the milk. Did I just have particularly dense loaf? the texture and cheesy factor were spot on, however the dish may have been intended to be more custard like than mine was. Regardless of intentions, this way came out great and I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing! As mentioned, reheats very well.</p>

				<p>I made this for Christmas morning brunch too. It got 5 stars from the judges! I was a little worried because I only had 6 eggs left in the house, and not enough fresh spinach but I just went with what I had and it was great. I was directed to your site by my daughter (she reads your blog) who made her aged parents a delicious Christmas Eve dinner using one of your recipes. She posted pics on her blog, you might want to check it out. :)<br />

We&#8217;re staying in a rented condo for the week and while the kitchen isn&#8217;t &#8220;fully stocked&#8221; as promised, we found enough cookware to throw this strata together.

<p>I&#8217;ve been reading your blog for a while now but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever commented.  I made this strata for Christmas morning, and it is absolutely amazing.  After breakfast, my husband told me that this needs to become a Christmas tradition- spinach strata every year!  Doesn&#8217;t sound like such a bad idea to me, as this was just about the easiest thing to put together.  Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<p>so i just came back to your site after a decent hiatus, and i was sad to see the internet advertising.  nothing was more grating and unpleasant than navigating to this lovely quiche-like dish and the adorable pictures of your family on a snowstormy weekend, and then bumping into an advertisement for a &#8220;jennifer&#8217;s body&#8221; dvd.  the ad then exploded, without my permission, into a screaming audio file and full-screen movie clip on my webpage before i could locate the (always discreetly placed) &#8220;close&#8221; box and make the madness stop.  I&#8217;m 27, which is to say i don&#8217;t yet consider myself a crotchety old modernity-hater, but this is terrible.</p>
<p>so, please, please, please, reconsider your advertising options.  i know you must make some money and what you do is of course a service to all of us wannabe kitchen artistes, but just&#8211;please.</p>

				<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This recipe calls for 9 eggs. Is it possible to do without or add few? I am not a big egg person and don&#8217;t like anything eggy. Also my little one is allergic to eggs, so I am trying to find recipes without having to use egg.</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions, it would be great to hear. I love the whole spinach, bread strata &#8211; it looks so delish!</p>

				<p>I waited and salivated for 24 hours, for this strata.  Got home from the gym tonight at 9:45PM and HAD to put the strata in the oven.  My tummy-personified was clawing at the oven door for the past 45 minutes because of the amazing smell wafting around my teeny tiny NYC apartment.  And now I&#8217;m eating a piece.  At 11:49PM.  On a weekday night, mere hours before I have to wake up again for work.  I have no self restraint, I know.  OMG, the strata is so heavenly fluffy.  It&#8217;s really light and kinda airy.  YUM.  This is my first smittenkitchen recipe attempt, and I&#8217;m in love.  Deb, I have a husband and you have a husband, but I&#8217;m a little bit in love with you too.  I have so much fun reading your posts!  Ok, done with my piece of the strata.  I want another.  By the way, I used 2% milk and 1/3 of some random loaf of white bread (pain au levain) from Whole Foods.  They ran out of Italian loaves.  I just dug into my 2nd piece.  Thank you for the recipe Deb!</p>

				<p>Glass should be fine. I didn&#8217;t add meat &#8212; much to my other half&#8217;s chagrin &#8212; but I&#8217;m sure any would work. If you skim the comments, looks like many others have added meat with success.</p>

				<p>Thank you so much for this recipe!  We had this Christmas morning, and instantly, my parents, husband and grandmother declared a must have for all Christmas mornings to come.  I actually used sharp cheddar, onions and prosciutto, along with the spinach.  It was amazing.  In my haste to finish assembling, I actually left out the milk, and had added about 2/3 cup of half and half to the eggs.  The end product was perfect, firm, not custardy( which I loved) and so rich. Thanks for a new tradition!</p>

				<p>I made this a few weeks ago, too! It was crazy-good, and I thought I might make two next time&#8230;one with pancetta for my meat-lovin&#8217; husband. I used gruyere, reggiano, and asiago. Yum.<br />
Made your gingerbread-apple upside down cake for Christmas dessert, and spiked the fresh whipped cream with cinnamon&#8230;again, YUM.</p>

				<p>Baguette (that&#8217;s French bread, right?), spinach and cheeses delivered by FreshDirect last night, now I just have to put it together before going out tonight so we can pop it in the oven when we stagger awake tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>One more step though: I have neither a glass nor ceramic baking dish, so it&#8217;ll be a quick stop at Williams Sonoma for the only 3 qt ceramic dish they have, which is the large Pillivuyt Rectangular Bakers for $99 (unless anyone can recommend a better/cheaper 3 qt ceramic baking dish that&#8217;s purchasable at Bloomingdale&#8217;s).</p>

				<p>We made a version of this wonderful strata as our 1st meal in 2010! Using ingredients on hand, I subbed sauteed mushrooms for the spinach, a very aged cheddar for the Gruyère, and made do with one egg + some egg beaters.  I also added some cooked &amp; crumbled bacon to some of the layers. Even with those substitutions, the strata was tres delish! I can&#8217;t wait to try the recipe as written, and am glad that we had enough ingredients to make some version. This was a fantastic start to the new year. Thank you!</p>

				<p>I too made this last night so we could bake it up in our post champagne haze and really bring in 2010 right.  I halved the recipe for the two of us, and used swiss rather than gruyere (cringe, and I scrapped the onion.  I&#8217;m not a huge onion fan and knowing myself, I knew i would find it too prominent in this situation).  It was delicious, alongside some bacon and pieces of a raspberry &#8220;kringle&#8221; that my southern in laws sent us.  Thank you!</p>

				<p>This was an amazing New Years morning meal!  Probably one of the easiest recipes I&#8217;ve ever done, with stunningly amazing results.  I pampered myself (and my guests!) with really high quality cheese and a nice hearty bread&#8211;it was just so impressively flavorful.

				<p>I&#8217;ve just hosted brunch a new year&#8217;s brunch after being inspired by your brunch post and made this strata as a centrepiece. it turned out beautifully (despite me worrying the whole night that i would get a soggy bread dish). My friends all digged into it and everyone loved how savoury it was! Thank you so much for introducing this wondering recipe and I will definitely be making this again and again for people who love eggs and brunch!</p>

				<p>I also made this for Christmas morning, and it was fan.tastic.  I added some baby portabellas to the onions for sauteeing, and mixed up the gruyere with some of trader joe&#8217;s english cheddar with carmelized onions.  Really really good.  We ate it and the leftovers for breakfast for 3 days in a row.  I also used a smaller dish, I think it was around 2 qts, so I just eyeballed the bread and did 6 instead of 9 eggs.  Seems like it&#8217;s not too hard to pare down the egg mixture.  I was surprised at how much bread this used &#8211; I used an entire bakery loaf of italian, with the crust removed.  and I did still use the entire box of frozen spinach in my smaller strata &#8211; I think any less would have been too little spinach. Thanks for another excellent recipe &#8211; this one will be made again!</p>

				<p>Just a word of warning: I made this using stale bread, assuming it would soggy up overnight anyways and turn out the same. However, it turned out too dry&#8211;needed more egg/milk mixture, I think.  I wished I had used fresh bread when i tasted it because I think the whole thing would&#8217;ve congealed together better making a more uniform strata texture rather than turning out like bits of bread with some cheese/spinach/egg on top.</p>

				<p>This recipe is delicious but I did use a whole bag of frozen spinach (16 ozs.) instead of just the 10 ozs.  I also didn&#8217;t have a 3 quart dish so I used a 2 quart dish and it seemed fine.  Excellent recipe and so perfect for a brunch!</p>

				<p>i made this for a brunch i went to this morning and it turned out perfectly, even though i didn&#8217;t have a 3-quart dish so i used a 2-quart dish and an 8&#215;8 baking dish and increased the quantities a little more.  it was fantastic and i got so many compliments!

				<p>I made this for a family brunch and nobody ate it- not even my 19 year old brother who eats like it&#8217;s always his last meal.  I ended up throwing the entire thing out.  The gruyere and mustard were too strong for my family and the strata never firmed up.  It was very soupy, even after microwaving a portion the next day.  However, the overall idea was great.  Next time, I&#8217;ll use cheddar cheese, more spinach and onion and maybe even some broccoli, and one or two less eggs.  Thanks for introducing me to this dish!</p>

				<p>So good it ended up being 5 servings rather than 6&#8230;</p>
<p>Deb, you were right, Bloomingdale&#8217;s had a less expensive option: I didn&#8217;t see your Calvin Klein in a 3 qt size, but they did have an All-Clad for $59 that came with a little wire holder to keep a hot ceramic dish from hurting the table. I think this dish was broader and shallower than yours, as we could only really fit one layer of each ingredient, but the strata was a great success. As AmberGale notes, the eggs can be slightly reduced (we used 8 instead of 9 so I would have enough eggs left to make a double recipe of your snickerdoodles) without losing flavor. I thought it might end up a little quiche-like, but my sister who dislikes quiche said No, the bread gave it a much more solid base than the pastry shells of quiches do. I got the FreshDirect parbaked baguette, which gave a kind of extra-fresh taste to the bread base as it finished baking while covered in cheese and egg, and like Amber used more bread (10 oz) than the recipe calls for.</p>
<p>Possibilities for next time: a friend suggests adding shiitake mushrooms; my sisters vote for sundried tomatoes and roasted peppers (we like color and kick in our food).</p>

				<p>I made this Christmas morning and then a week later, when more family and friends came to lunch.  It&#8217;s absolutely delicious.  I meant to use gruyere, but lost the block in the Christmas Eve party insanity.  So I substituted smoked gouda, and everyone raved.  Will try with the gruyere next time.</p>

<p>I tried this one for today&#8217;s dinner. Had some day old bread lying around.<br />
I was in a bit of a hurry, so I kinda skipped the whole 8-hour hibernation.</p>
<p>Added a couple of slices of Portuguese smoked ham to top it, plus some mushrooms.<br />
A nice frizzante red wine to go with it.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I have a potluck breakfast at my school next week.  I&#8217;m a new person on staff, and would really like to bring in something that will help express my thanks to everyone who has helped me with the transition, and thought this might be a great dish to do it with! Any idea how it will hold up to being cooked at home, driven about 20 minutes to school, and then served at a come and go type seating?  For example, if it came out of the oven at around 7.00, got to school around 7.30, and was served from 7.45-8.00 until around 8.45?<br />
Thanks!<br />

				<p>Deb- Thanks for replying so quickly! I ended up making it on Friday, and it was a huge success! I&#8217;ve been asked to make it again for another breakfast, and a few people asked for the recipe. For the record, i took it out of the oven at 7, got to school at 7.30ish, and breakfast started around 8, and it was fine for the whole breakfast. I just kept it covered in foil until we were ready to start eating.</p>

				<p>I was wondering if fresh baby spinach works with this or is frozen the way to go?  I saw one post that touched on this but didn&#8217;t say how it came out?  We are going to make this for Easter and I was thinking fresh might be nice if it works.  I love your blog!!</p>

				<p>I made this recipe last night to serve this morning and what a hit it was!  The family just raved about it.  I used fresh baby spinach that I chopped and just wilted over the onions when they were almost finished cooking.  I noticed that after the casserole cooled a bit, the water in the spinach did leach out some into the dish.  It didn&#8217;t make the casserole seem soggy while it was hot though.  Next time, I think I will wilt the spinach alone and wring it out before I add it to the onions.  </p>
<p>I used some leftover potato bread that I had made a few days ago as it was starting to get dry;  it worked well in this.  I also used Swiss Emmethaler instead of Gruyere; it melted beautifully and is a little less sharp and less expensive.   It seems this is one of those recipes that will work with lots of change ups as long as the proportions of bread, eggs and milk are kept in mind!   Loved this!</p>

				<p>I am going to try this. And I want to join my praises to the others who love this blog. I just chanced upon it, and I love the deft way you write, the design of the site, the outstanding photos, and your very good recipes. High class blogging, I&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>In this strata, I love the addition of spinach. I made a strata for a Good Friday meal for a group of adults and kids between the 9 a.m. Tenebrae service and the noon celebration of the Passion of Christ at my church.  Whatever I made had to be meatless, calorie dense, and nourishing, because for many it would be a big part of their only meal of the day. </p>
<p>First, I had started out wanting to make bread pudding, but realized that savory was needed that day, not sweets.  I scanned many recipes for &#8220;breakfast casserole,&#8221; strata, and any other recipe that had bread and eggs baked together, and I found out the proportions of eggs to milk and bread can vary wildly.  So Susan, we can even change the proportions with impunity. And so far, whatever proportions I&#8217;ve tried have come out good.</p>

				<p>A keeper recipe. I put this dish together last night before I went to bed. I added about 1/3 lb. of diced ham, and I used bread from a sourdough baguette. We ate it this morning with some simple fruit salad on the side, and we loved it! I might add some artichokes next time, I bet they would incredible. Thanks for sharing this.</p>

				<p>I made this for a pot luck brunch and found that it travelled well. I covered it with foil after taking it out of the oven and drove 30 minutes to the brunch. It stayed warm in a 200 degree oven for another half hour or so until it was time to eat. It stayed moist and warm and tasted fantastic. I wilted ~10 oz of fresh baby spinach (a bag and a half of the pre-bagged stuff) and squeezed out the water before adding &#8211; next time I will use a bit more spinach.</p>

				<p>I never commented on this recipe, but I definitely need to share that this is one of my favorite things you&#8217;ve posted.  I made it for Christmas morning when my mom came to visit (her first time in NYC!).  When her flight was delayed and she didn&#8217;t get in until Christmas night, we just ate it the next morning.  I&#8217;m so glad I had picked something that could stay in the fridge, patiently awaiting her arrival.  It was one of my first meals in a new apartment (I moved to Bklyn two days before Christmas) and also one of my first christmas meals away from home.  I feel a tradition beginning&#8230;.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me start a new and delicious cycle of memories.</p>

				<p>I just made this for a bridal shower I&#8217;m throwing tomorrow. I haven&#8217;t baked the whole thing yet, I pulled some out to bake early cause I have to know how it tastes, and Deb I just want you to know that frozen chopped artichokes mixed in with the spinach make this spectacular (I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s great without them too though). It was like eating artichoke spinach dip in a bread bowl for breakfast. I know you love artichokes so I thought I&#8217;d share.</p>

				<p>I thought this was fantastic.  Everyone enjoyed it and thought of tasty additions for next time &#8211; artichokes, asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, etc.  Also, most people really liked &#8220;edge&#8221; pieces because of the crunch, so next time I might try making mini-stratas in large muffin tins so that there is more crust.<br />
Thanks for another winner Deb!</p>

				<p>Deb&#8211;I can&#8217;t wait to make this for a brunch I&#8217;m hosting this coming weekend. I&#8217;m new to egg bakes like this, though, and am wondering, if I increase the amount of eggs et al. in the recipe to serve a greater number of people, do I need to increase the cooking time? E.g. if I double the recipe, do I need to double the cooking time? </p>
<p>Thanks for your help! Your blog is my new absolute favorite.</p>

				<p>Wow, I just made th is strata today, but without the fridge time. ;) It turned out superbly well, though I used a pretty high quality bread that wasn&#8217;t too absorbent so their was some egg mixture leakage. :c It tasted amazing, and I made the fantastic tomato sauce to gowith it. Yum!</p>

				<p>Even in the heat of summer, this strata is insanely good! I made this with Sullivan St sourdough, and subbed in an equal mix of havarti, cheddar and goat for the 6oz of gruyere. Oh and made it even more decadent by using part heavy cream, part milk. Woah. How did I ever expect to not love eggy, savory bread pudding?!</p>

				<p>I made this a couple of weeks ago and split it across two dishes  as I didn&#8217;t have a spare one large enough.  We only  baked one and I put the other in the freezer uncooked.  Cooked it today and it was brilliant &#8211; no different to the one made fresh.  So this is going to become my regular brunch dish as I&#8217;ll only have to make it once every two brunches :) I got it out of the freezer on the morning of the day before and left it in the fridge, and took it out of the fridge a couple of hours before cooking to be sure it had defrosted.   Delish.  Oooh, and I like the idea of muffin sized ones Rose &#8211; might try that next time.</p>

				<p>I made this today for brunch, along with the winter fruit salad, and both were a huge hit!  I did almost double the spinach, and because of this added one extra egg and a bit more nutmeg.  So easy to make ahead, because of this dish, I&#8217;ll be making brunch a regular thing this winter.</p>

				<p>Deb, I was so happy to discover your site recently via the Flipboard app on my iPad. Out of the seemingly hundreds of food/recipe blogs/sites I&#8217;ve perused over the years yours really stands out. Your pictures are gorgeous and your writing is utterly engaging. Anyway, I just had to write after making this strata yesterday for 2 girlfriends.  They (and I) absolutely LOVED this dish. The 3 of us devoured almost the entire dish minus a tiny leftover piece. Thanks for sharing all these great recipes. You&#8217;ve definitely inspired me to cook more. Happy New Year!!</p>

				<p>Am making this fabulous strata for the third time in as many weeks for different groups of family/friends.  Everyone raves about it.  I&#8217;m a new follower of your blog and have recommended it everytime I&#8217;ve served the strata. I&#8217;ve served it along with Canadian bacon, sausage and no meat at all. A medley of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries served along with it has also been a big hit.  Cinnamon coffee cake is also a nice addition to the plate.  Keep up your remarkably interesting work!</p>

				<p>I found the Smitten Kitchen a few weeks ago hunting for Buckeye Ball recipes, and have been a devoted fan ever since.  I just wanted to let you know that I made a version of this strata for New Years Day breakfast for my whole family, and it was a *huge* hit.  </p>
<p>I was using a 13 x 9 pan, so I used a whole loaf of sourdough bread, 12 double yolk eggs, and added sauteed mushrooms in place of the onions (I&#8217;m allergic).  My cheese shop talked me into using a good 2-year aged gouda in place of the Gruyere ($18.99+ a pound was a little too rich), and the whole thing turned out beautifully.  Puffy, rounded brown crust, lots of melty cheese throughout, and pretty much all of the eggy custard absorbed into the bread.  It made 12 substantial servings, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to the leftovers.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;m curious about, though . . . how in the *world* do you fit three full layers of all the ingredients into your pan?  Even in the relatively deep 13 x 9 glass pyrex baking dish I could only fit two.  Do you cut up your bread into smaller than a 1 inch dice?</p>

				<p>I made this last night since I promised to bring breakfast to a cat shelter at a distressingly early hour. I used some torn up rustic rolls from Fresh and Easy&#8217;s clearance rack, and half a leek instead of onion.<br />
Even after a 45 minute drive in a cold car, it was still piping hot when I got there. Everyone loved it and it served more than 8.<br />
Here&#8217;s the best part. I had some for dinner and I enjoyed it. And I hate eggs!</p>

				<p>This is my first time commenting&#8211;I made this for Mother&#8217;s Day, and it was wonderful.  I made and froze, unbaked, and put in the fridge to defrost the morning before I was going to make it.  We ate at noon, so I pulled it out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter for one hour before putting in the pre-heated oven at 11:00.  It took 55 minutes to bake in my oven, which is usually pretty accurate.  No one could tell it had been frozen, and even the hardcore meat eaters in my family loved it, including my 4 year old son.  Thank you!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this a couple of times now. This last time, I somehow forgot that the strata was supposed to sit in the fridge overnight before baking and only re-discovered this at 8:30 pm, with the strata all assembled and me too ravenous to make another dinner&#8230;so I just popped it in the oven anyway.<br />
It actually turned out really well&#8211;it needed about an extra 15 minutes or so in the oven, just because there was more liquid floating around, having not had a chance to get absorbed by the bread. It was also more souffle- or quiche-like (done properly, it&#8217;s more like bread pudding). So, if you&#8217;ve made the same silly mistake as me, no need to worry. The recipe still works out.</p>

				<p>This was great.  I have been wanting to try a strata.  I had baugette, gruyere and sliced red pepper left over from a dinner party.  Adding some kale I had frozen in the fall and fresh chives, I put it together the next morning for an easy dinner.  My dish was deep, so it took a while to cook, but it was very tasty.  Thank you for all of the inspiration. I served two of your dishes at the party.</p>

				<p>So I just made this for my family this morning. My husband didn&#8217;t even speak until he was done. Then he raved about it through two more servings. Lol! Thanks Deb, without you my husband wouldn&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m really not that amazing at cooking!</p>

				<p>Holy. Hells. Bells.  I prepped this last night and baked it this morning for my office&#8217;s holiday breakfast.  Everyone raves about those little mini souffles from Panera bread. Those little souffles might as well just hand over their crown of glory.  Right now.  This moment.  Yes, right now; because their reign is OVER!  Because this recipe tops anything they had going for them, except maybe the convenience of someone else making them.  This recipe is the end all, be all: puffy, fluffy, flaky, springy, moist, salty, savoury, golden deliciousness of a breakfast casserole you have been searching for.  The search is over; your quest is complete!  Enjoy knowing all your future breakfasts (which include this dish) will be a smashing success!</p>

				<p>This is now a christmas brunch tradition- we have it every year and love it. It is perfect in every way! The only adjustment is adding two boxes of frozen spinach instead of one. The nutmeg, dijon, and gruyere is genius!</p>

				<p>Made this for a luncheon and it was a huge success.  It also reheats beautifully in the microwave for a minute or covered in a 325 oven for about 15 minutes.  Used a pound of fresh baby spinach that I sauteed with the onions &#8211; fantastic!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this twice for brunch when we&#8217;ve had out of town guests staying overnight.   So easy to pop this in the oven in the morning, after having secretly assembled it the day before, prior to guests arriving.  Everyone loves this strata &#8211; thank you so much for the recipe!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of stratas, quiches, frittata and the like, so am not the best judge, but thought this recipe had a nice balance of flavours and textures. I used a 16 oz bag of fresh spinach that I wilted down because the frozen spinach in the grocery stores here in Canada has very little nutritional value, so it&#8217;s kind of pointless to include except for colour. Not sure that I would make this again as it&#8217;s not really my thing, but did appreciate the make ahead factor and its utility as a vegetarian main. Also, the leftovers reheated really well in the microwave, even three days later.</p>

				<p>Just made this for Sunday Easter Brunch and it was a huge success! So simple, made it the night before and then just tossed it in the oven in the morning. Delicious and simple. Complete crowd pleaser.<br />
Affordable, too!</p>

				<p>Strata is my new favorite food.  I get to use up leftovers and can eat off it for an entire weekend = AWESOME.  Thanks Deb!  I was unwilling to wait overnight so after assembling (and waiting for the oven to preheat) I covered it with plastic wrap and weighed it down with the Joy of Cooking and a few large tomato cans, moving them every 5-10 minutes to make sure the weight got evenly distributed.</p>
