I uploaded pictures of this recipe yesterday onto Flickr, but didn&#8217;t get to telling you all about it because I was feeling a little lackadaisical after that whole seven days in a row of posting thing. Three hours later, I received this comment: &#8220;Omg, post the recipe already!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmph! I thought. The natives are getting restless.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2709780911/" title="blueberries, rinsed"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/2709780911_948256588f_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="blueberries, rinsed" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2710598886/" title="making the pastry"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2710598886_c336584469_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="making the pastry" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2709784433/" title="patting down the base"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3112/2709784433_740edf8556_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="patting down the base" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2710603828/" title="spreading the blueberry filling"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2710603828_c2e99f940c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="spreading the blueberry filling" /></a></p>
<p>But who could blame them? Just look at these things! And, oh, to taste them. (As I just did. Because the memory of their deliciousness was vague and I had to. For the sake of clarification.) They&#8217;re tart and buttery and fruity and tangy and crumbly&#8230;  And well, I understand why anyone would get impatient. Can you imagine how much people would revolt if they knew that I had baked these <i>a whole five days ago</i> and have kept them from you since?</p>
<p>It could get ugly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2710609900/" title="ready to bake by smitten, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/2710609900_b1b5a21163_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="ready to bake" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2710612440/" title="just from the oven"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3212/2710612440_079f242b27_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="just from the oven" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2709808669/" title="blueberry crumb bars"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/2709808669_1be3090558_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="blueberry crumb bars" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2710630986/" title="blueberry crumb bars"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2248/2710630986_10d5692b60_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="blueberry crumb bars" /></a></p>

<p>But if there ever were a dessert worth getting ugly for, it would have to be this. It manages to be The Very Dessert We Were Looking For To Use Up The Greenmarket Berries We Went Gaga Over but also The Perfect Solution to Picnic and Pot-Luck Dessert Limitations as well as&#8211;shh, don&#8217;t tell anyone&#8211;Seriously The Easiest Thing in the Whole World to Make. But we&#8217;ll just call them Blueberry Crumb Bars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Omg, post the recipe already!&#8221;</p>
<p>As you wish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2709804969/" title="blueberry crumb bar"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/2709804969_f42e7f8c2e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="blueberry crumb bar" /></a>
<p><b>Blueberry Crumb Bars</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Blueberry-Crumb-Bars/Detail.aspx">AllRecipes.com</a></p>
<p>Recipes like this make me wonder why I don&#8217;t use AllRecipes.com more. After seeing a blueberry crumb bar on another site, I immediately wanted to make them but the first recipe seemed overly fussy. I knew there was a simpler way to do it, and lo and behold, All Recipes had it. Once I swapped the shortening for butter&#8211;of course&#8211;and dolled it up with some lemon juice and lemon zest, they were just as heavenly as the 176 commenters promised they&#8217;d be.</p>
<p>I could imagine easily swapping another fruit or berry for the blueberries&#8211;I&#8217;m especially thinking something tart like sour cherries or cranberries in the fall (I&#8217;d use orange instead of lemon with cranberries). But if you have blueberries on hand, do not miss a chance to make these. </p>
<p>These are easiest to cut once chilled, and store even better in the fridge than they do at room temperature&#8211;something unusual for cookies!</p>
<p>Yield: I cut these into 36 smallish rectangles</p>
<p>1 cup white sugar<br />
1 teaspoon baking powder<br />
3 cups all-purpose flour<br />
1 cup cold unsalted butter (2 sticks or 8 ounces)<br />
1 egg<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
Zest and juice of one lemon<br />
4 cups fresh blueberries<br />
1/2 cup white sugar<br />
4 teaspoons cornstarch</p>
<p>   1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9&#215;13 inch pan.</p>
<p>   2. In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup sugar, 3 cups flour, and baking powder. Mix in salt and lemon zest. Use a fork or pastry cutter to blend in the butter and egg. Dough will be crumbly. Pat half of dough into the prepared pan.</p>
<p>   3. In another bowl, stir together the sugar, cornstarch and lemon juice. Gently mix in the blueberries. Sprinkle the blueberry mixture evenly over the crust. Crumble remaining dough over the berry layer.</p>
<p>   4. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until top is slightly brown. (This took an extra 10 to 15 minutes in my oven.) Cool completely before cutting into squares.</p>

				<p>Lisa &#8212; Yes. I mean, I didn&#8217;t because they&#8217;re in season and everywhere, even cheap, but I have more than once used frozen blueberries in the place of fresh ones and found them astoundingly good. They&#8217;re just one of those fruits that freezes impeccably.</p>

				<p>Oh man. Want those now. </p>
<p>I made your chocolate pudding the other day, using mostly Mexican chocolate, and goat milk (because that&#8217;s what I had). Turned out great! (<a href="http://kittbo.blogspot.com/2008/07/mexican-chocolate-pudding.html" rel="nofollow">Pictures here.</a>) </p>
<p>(Well, the goat milk I had was a little too funky, but the recipe is quite sound, and it will be better next time. Thanks!)</p>

				<p>Yes, I froze mine already! I had made them thinking that something I was going to this weekend was last weekend, and wanted to store them. I ended up slicing them once they were cold, and because I was being extra OCD about them not sticking together, put those little pieces of wax paper around each before freezing them in a container.</p>

				<p>Oh. My. Word.</p>
<p>You see, I&#8217;m a lover of all things blueberry, and I think it started as a wee child and I hated Strawberry Shortcake (she was such a poser) but was in love with Blueberry Muffin. </p>
<p>It only became more of an intense love as I grew older when I learned how butter and cream made everything taste better&#8230; and well, I love anything with a crumb topping. Apples and crumbs. Apples and rhubarb and crumbs. Cookies and crumbs.</p>
<p>And blueberries and crumbs and ice-cream and comfy couch and a good movie and a summer night and an open door. Oh, and no interrupting phone calls.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to be thinking about these the whole time, hopefully I won&#8217;t start drooling.</p>

				<p>Yummy!  Thanks for the inspiration.  I shall be hunting for blueberries here in the desert.</p>
<p>I love allrecipes.com.  I go there when I&#8217;m looking for something really specific but need to have someone tell me what they&#8217;ve done when they experimented.  For example, my kids are heading back to school and I wanted to make some granola bars to have on hand for snacks as I am trying to limit all the additives in the store-bought variety.  After a bit of research on allrecipes.com, I found a recipe with a bunch of suggestions (&#8220;use less brown sugar&#8221; and &#8220;you can swap out all or part of the oil&#8221;, etc) that seemed like it would work.  And it did!</p>

				<p>I just made some a lot like these out of Fine Cooking Magazine. They have oats and brown sugar in the crust and topping, and the blueberry layer also has condensed milk with lemon juice and zest. They are deliciously gooey, and the oats make the crust and crumble kind of chewy. Oats also make them breakfasty enough to be eaten at absolutely any time of day. Multiple times a day. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re in the July 2008 issue along with some other blueberry dessert recipes.</p>

I want to make a layer cake for a shower this weekend and I immediatly thought of the wedding cake.  I wanted to do something other than a plain chocolate ganache for the filling.  Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>After jellying, jamming, syruping, baking, processing and freezing over 40 pounds of various types of u-picked berries, part of me is very angry with you for posting this recipe. However, when I see the look on my 2 and 4 year old blueberry-devouring monster&#8217;s faces when I make these tomorrow, I&#8217;m sure it will be more than worth it.</p>

				<p>Oh, darn, this means I have to go pick more blueberries, since we&#8217;ve powered through most of 3 pounds or so in the past couple weeks.  Poor me.  (Urgh, sarcasm comes poorly through the internet &#8211; let me say that I was a migrant berry picker in a past life and it is one of my very favorite things to do, berry picking.

				<p>I worked at a bakery that made blueberry bars in the summer and apple raspberry in the fall.  I know it was more involved because you cooked the rasperries down to an almost jam like state, but they were frickin amazing!  These look incredible.</p>

				<p>Erin &#8212; It was a Bittersweet Brandied Ganache. However, the original recipe was intended to coat an entire wedding cake, so I would scale it down substantially. (I used a one pound of chocolate level for each filling layer of the 12-inch square cake, if that gives you any guidance.) 3 1/2 lbs. bittersweet chocolate + 3 1/2 sticks butter + 3 1/2 cups heavy cream + 2/3 cup brandy or cognac. Melt the chocolate and butter together in a double boiler, whisk in the cream, then the brandy. Allow to cool to the right consistency.</p>
<p>Everyone &#8212; I brought these bars to my friend Jocelyn&#8217;s last night after they&#8217;d been in the fridge for two days, the freezer for three and the fridge for another day defrosting. Um, they got a little soft. Now, obviously I did not store them properly&#8211;if you&#8217;re going to freeze them, don&#8217;t wait days to do it&#8211;but due to the wetness of the filling, I wouldn&#8217;t cook these more than a day or two before you&#8217;ll serve them.

				<p>Ok, so I&#8217;m guessing you don&#8217;t have a good recipe for the beans then! ;) I will forgive you for your fabulous blueberry bars &#8211; the colour is absolutely stunning. I too felt like I had to rest after I did a 7 day posting thing but then I just remembered you once did a whole month!! Now THAT is stamina.</p>

				<p>Wow! My go-to recipe for blueberries is my blueberry buckle recipe from 1982 but I am dying to try these. Would be great with homemade vanilla ice cream on a hot summer nite.Thanks for the update on freezing and storing, I was thinking they might get soggy unless you freeze right away. @Sophie, I&#8217;m not crazy about allrecipes.com either. Some of the recipes are just plain bizarre, like the ones for slow cooker (my fave winter appliance) &#8211; onion soup mix, cans of soup, etc. Yuck!</p>

				<p>Jeez lord!  My mom goes blueberry picking every year.  This year I insisted on going with her.  It was so much fun and we timed it perfectly-getting to the farm just when the berries were the perfect ripeness and hadn&#8217;t been picked through yet&#8230;so needless to say that I have a TON in my freezer.  I must make these bars!!!  I made a devine coffee cake from another site and think that these superb looking treats will be perfect to make for a dinner party  that I am going to on Friday.  Thanks for the inspiration.</p>

				<p>I know your wedding cake project is completely over and done with, but I have a wedding cake question. How did you move each tiers to stack one on top of each other without distorting the icing on the tiers below? To me, this is the hardest part of the assemly process. Thanks!</p>

				<p>A little later in the season, try making this with those little tart plums they break out at the markets.  I made something very similar last year and it was the best thing I&#8217;ve ever eaten.  No one believes me, but plum bars are the future of late summer desserts!  Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll have to go find me some blueberries&#8230;</p>

				<p>I *just* took these out of the oven about a half hour ago and already showed them off on my blog. Thanks so much for sharing them here! However, I only had 2 cups of berries, but I think they came out fine. Oh, and there was no way I was gonna be able to wait for them to completely cool without checking to see if they were, yanno, edible first! Scooped some into a bowl and used a fork. DIVINE!</p>

				<p>Apart from  the fact that this is the 93 comment on these beautiful guys, I figured I still ought to mention a little something (knowing of course that it is quite probable that the exact same thing was said 43 comments before!! You know your a food blog phoneme when&#8230;)<br />
I to JUST made these, this past weekend! I bookmarked a recipe for hem months ago (Amercias Test Kitchen), but they turned out pretty poorly!! The top was FAR to dry.. now I wished you posted this last friday!!! Those look and sound gorgeous!!<br />
Mine were half a batch of raspberry (fresh picked from my backyard nonetheless &#8211; so obviously tasted superior to the blueberry which was the second batch!! But that is simply a biased opinion. I really do prefer blueberry!!! Such as yours.<br />
Ok, far too long a comment. To sum up &#8211; beautiful! I&#8217;ll try out your version, sound fab-itty-FAB!!</p>

				<p>I am not overly fond of blueberry desserts, or blueberries in general, but the pictures made me desperate to make them. I ran to the store after work yesterday and got the needed ingredients, hurried home and made them immediately, My husband and son watched me and asked what was for dinner. </p>
<p>Dinner? Oh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>So I threw a pizza in the pizza oven for them. </p>
<p>These are absolutely FABULOUS!!! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe and your tweaks to it. Shortening was in the original recipe? Blasphemy! Butter is the only way to go. I also had a cheat in my little jar of Penzeys lemon zest and a little bit of lemon juice from a bottle, since lemons are hit or miss around here.</p>
<p>Sooooooo yummy!</p>

				<p>i was having a major dilemma on what to make for dessert for friends who are major chocoholics and instead of a fussy chocolate cheesecake i decided on a whim just to make whatever deb posted next (i was sure it was going to be dessert and i was right).  i used splenda baking sugar and don&#8217;t know if that affected the taste, but i thought they could be sweeter.  next time i&#8217;d up the sugar content in the blueberries and add some brown sugar to the crumb topping.  my friends devoured it though, and even took home the extras. so thanks!</p>

				<p>I made these last night and we (mom, dad and two kids) ate them for breakfast with chicken apple sausage.  Bad Mommy &#8211; - dessert for breakfast&#8230;but they looked so good I couldn&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t eat dairy, so I swapped the butter for margarine and had to use arrowroot because I didn&#8217;t have cornstarch.  They turned out great.  Thanks for the receipe.</p>

				<p>Just made these. My husband and I are impatient heathens, so we ate them while they were still steaming. I&#8217;m happy to say that with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, these are divine warm. Even better, the blueberries didn&#8217;t run, so the rest will set fine for bars. I get to have my cake and eat it too! Yay!</p>

				<p>I made these but cause Ireland isn&#8217;t famous for it&#8217;s blueberry gluts ( they are so expensive!) swapped in 3 cups frozen cherries with one fresh blueberry. </p>
<p>They are gorgeous. i don&#8217;t think my dough was crumbly enough through &#8211; can&#8217;t do mixing with forks so rubbed it by hand and it was a bit chunky shall we say. but refridgerated overnight and they are yummy today</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a newcomer to your site and I&#8217;ve been sorta stalking it lately, trying to find the right thing to make.  This recipe did it for me.  I actually went out and bought blueberries and a lemon (I had everything else) and made this recipe immediatly after I read it.  Then I helped myself to three big bars.  After licking my fingers I decided to share with my coworkers the next day, which I did.  They all loved it as much as I did.<br />
I have a feeling this will be the first of many recipes I make from your site.  :)<br />
Thank you.  Love your site!</p>

				<p>I made these two nights ago to bring to work.  While they were still warm, my boyfriend at about an eigth of the pan&#8230; grrr. Oh well, he really liked them.  I let them cool, then put them in the fridge overnight to chill, then cut them into bars in the morning, but they were still a bit to moist to hold together into perfect bars.  They put the crumble in &#8220;blueberry crumble bars&#8221; but it didn&#8217;t matter, they were amazing!  Eaten in about half an hour at work by everyone.  Plus I had the bar rejects at home to keep for me and the boyfriend.  YUM!!</p>

				<p>They just finished cooling off and there&#8217;s, um, already a rather large chunk missing out of my pan. I honestly don&#8217;t know how that happened. &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>They are super-delicious &#8211; and I love a recipe that&#8217;s hands-on like this one. I mixed the berries with the sugar by hand and I love getting to push dough around; it makes me feel a little more accomplished, you know?

				<p>Hi there, I&#8217;m new here. Discovered your blog last week just in time to see these little morsels of blueberry goodness. Now I&#8217;m here to tell you that they are awesome made with a combination of apricots (from my CSA but not quite tasty enough to eat out of hand) and blueberries (from my freezer, picked by me a couple of weeks ago). I thought about increasing the sugar to account for the tartness of the apricots, but I didn&#8217;t and they turned out perfect&#8211;really a delicious combination. Thanks!</p>

				<p>I was just thinking of looking for a blueberry recipe and here it is!  But I don&#8217;t have 4 cups, so I&#8217;ll have to combine them with another fruit like peaches or something.  Either that or I&#8217;m off to the store to get buttermilk for the Nappa cabbage salad with buttermilk dressing and more blueberries.</p>

				<p>I just made these for a party and by god they went fast! Absolutely delicious, Deb. Good thing I left a few behind in the fridge at home &#8211; we just ate them for breakfast and they were heavenly. I only made a few minor tweaks to the recipe (I always seem to do that&#8230; just can&#8217;t leave any recipe alone): I made the dough in the food processor, and added a whole vanilla bean to the flour mixture before the butter and ground it up until it was just fine brown flecks in the dough (YUM!). I also added a dash of cinnamon to the blueberries which was awesome. Though it seems like a strange combination, I find that cinnamon and blueberries go incredibly well together. But then, I love just about ANYTHING blueberry.</p>

				<p>I did make these the other day and they were very very good. I have some leftover blueberries and will mix them with my garden raspberries for another try. I served with ice-cream to guests, but decided a small dollop of whipped cream would have been better. The taste of the bars is so delicate that ice-cream boga down the flavor. The lemon in the bars is essential and what makes them so good (as far as I am concerned). Thanks!!!</p>

I&#8217;ve been oloking at this recipe all week, and thinking&#8230; mmm.. maybe on the weekend! It&#8217;s not blueberry season in wintery south africa so I used frozen mixed berries instead. YUMMMEEEEHHH!!! It&#8217;s soft and crunchy at the same time, and not too sweet. Perf!<br />
Thanks!<br />

				<p>I just took these out of the oven for dinner @ my mum&#8217;s house&#8230; and really, my house smells AMAZING right now.  If the pan wasn&#8217;t so hot, I would have dove in by now. ;)</p>

				<p>I made these a couple days ago, and they turned out sublime. I received some unbearably cute spring forms for my birthday and have been going hog wild with ANYTHING that will go into them. They are perfect sized for a little blueberry crumblet and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum! :)</p>

				<p>Lovely. Made these just now. I think I would try to make more crust next time, or pick out smaller blueberries. Seemed like my blueberry to crust ratio was a bit off. The lemon taste came out strong, but I kinda like it :)</p>

<p>These would have been SO much better!</p>

				<p>Everything I have made from one of your recipes always comes out great.  These took 50 minutes at 400 degrees in my electric oven.  I picked up fresh blueberries from the Farmer&#8217;s Market this morning just so I could make these, and they came out wonderfully.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>i&#8217;ve been working on blueberry pie and different kinds of crumble bars this summer, so i was super-excited to try this. now i feel like the partypooper here, but i was tremendously disappointed with how they turned out and had to throw the whole thing away. it was a tray of mush instead of crumble and flat-tasting blueberries. since i&#8217;ve been working with the same kind of blueberries for the last month and had better experiences, i can only guess that it was the cornstarch flattening out the flavor, too much juice from the blueberries, and the lack of sturdy stuff in the crumble.</p>
<p>here&#8217;s what i would try next time:<br />
the oat mix crumble crust from <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2008/05/apricot-bars-are-they-for-breakfastor-dessert/" rel="nofollow">Pioneer Woman&#8217;s Apricot Bars</a> (which I usually make with strawberry preserves and hold together really well for the 15 minutes before i eat them all up)</p>
<p>plus</p>
<p>the blueberry pie filling from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated June 2008, made with grated apple, lemon, and ground tapioca, none of which you can taste overtly. it involves a little more work (cooking half the blueberries, extra mixing bowls), but the filling holds together firmly, tastes fresh and blueberry, and doesn&#8217;t get soggy or runny. the pie is amazing, if you haven&#8217;t made it yet.</p>
<p>i think with a sturdy base, filling with more structural integrity, and unmuted blueberry flavor, these would turn out a lot more like bars that could withstand the many long minutes until they were cool enough to eat. hmm. now i need to get more blueberries.</p>

				<p>I made these this evening to go with our grilled dinner.  They were a hit, but I cheated and mixed the dough in the food processor.  I was worried that there wouldn&#8217;t be enough &#8220;crumble,&#8221; but it worked great.  They could have used even a little more lemon/spice for my taste, but they were an unmitigated success.  We even started to eat them before they were cool and they held together and were sturdy enough to pick up and eat.  As always, thanks Deb.</p>

				<p>After summers of picking blueberries in Michigan I&#8217;m not impressed by the ones we get here in London, which have been flown in from Poland, so I used raspberries for the crumble and it was delicious! Had to keep my eye on the amount of butter I used since my conversions are always questionable, but it was pretty easy to guess what the crumble consistency should be like. Brought the dish to a pot luck luncheoon and all the girls loved it. Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>Just made these over the weekend from blueberries I picked up at the Rock Center Greenmarket and they are AMAZING. So quick and easy. We have been eating it with vanilla yogurt as a justification to eat them first thing in the morning! </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already picked up more blueberries to make another batch. I also plan on adding raspberries for a little twist.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing a great find!</p>

				<p>i made these for a bbq this weekend &amp; they were gone immediately!  i realized when i was half way through the recipe that i only had about a cup &amp; a half of flour in my kitchen, so i used whole wheat pastry flour for the remainder &amp; it was great&#8230; couldn&#8217;t even tell.  i think i&#8217;ll make them that way again</p>

				<p>These were amazing &#8211; had a little bite while they were still warm and then they went into the fridge for a day to chill out before slicing.  I lined the pan with parchment paper which made it a lot easier to pull them out of the pan for slicing.  Excellent with vanilla bean ice cream&#8230;</p>
<p>Next time, I might try the blueberry filling with the grated shortbread crust&#8230;</p>

				<p>Wow! You&#8217;ve done it again, Deb! These are amazing. Well, my rendition of them is amazing&#8230;I didn&#8217;t have blueberries but due to organic cherries being $1.99 for a 1lb pack (brag, yes, living in California is awesome), I had lots of cherries. So, cherries it  is&#8230;I used orange zest and juice instead of lemon (more out of necessity) and they taste delicious. The perfect summer dessert and a nice (I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this) departure from chocolate.<br />
You are brilliant.</p>

				<p>I made these and found the recipe kind of&#8230;boring. Very, very rich. I&#8217;d probably only use 3/4 of a stick of butter next time or less. And there wasn&#8217;t a whole lot going on. Maybe next time I&#8217;ll toss a smidge of nutmeg or allspice in with the berries. I found myself wishing that there was some kind of cream cheesy feeling to go with the bars.</p>

simple recipes&#8230;.so good.  I made these yesterday and we had<br />

				<p>This is about the fifth recipe I&#8217;ve made from this seriously inspiring website&#8230;and these bars are divine!  We are all about local, organic, sustainable in Portland, and this recipe just capitalizes on this season&#8217;s amazing blueberries.  The touch of lemon is perfect&#8230;makes for a great balance of sweet and tart, which is aces in my book.  Thanks for providing one of the best food sites-it&#8217;s always a treat to see what you&#8217;re working on.</p>

				<p>Ok, so I&#8217;m late to the party &#8211; but boy, what a party it is!  Can I tell you how wonderful the blueberries smell in my oven right now?  I added a sprinkle of brown sugar (because you just can&#8217;t have enough sugar, right?), and I can&#8217;t wait to see how my first attempt turns out.</p>
<p>I am SO glad I bought that 2lb container of blueberries at Whole Foods this morning &#8211; I&#8217;m even happier that I had today off so I could make these!  Thank you for making my day. :D</p>

				<p>I just made these for my church hospitality table&#8230;my platter came back to me empty.  I guess they were a hit.  Of course I saved some for my family&#8230;my children couldn&#8217;t have enough.  :)  Thanks for posting the recipe.  It is always a pleasure to read and learn from your blog!  :)<br />

				<p>i made these yesterday -i added a handful of freshly grated ginger into the berry mixture and i added about 1 or 2 T chopped crystallized ginger to the topping.  the ginger added a wonderful complement to the berries and lemony notes.  yumm.</p>

				<p>I am making these amazing treats for the second time in under a week, thanks to an abundance of wild blueberries. I fear addiction. I fear summer (and thus, berry season) ending.</p>
<p>Although, autumnal apples might make for a tasty adaptation. Hmmm.</p>

				<p>I had fun making these and my mother and her boyfriend had beyond a blast eating them, as I delivered them for his August delivery from his Christmas gift (homemade dessert a month, with all the credit given to your website as always).  They reported that they LOVED them and couldn&#8217;t decide if they enjoyed them more cold or heated up with vanilla ice cream on top.  They&#8217;ve requested another pan to decide :)  Thank you for sharing such wonderful recipes!</p>

				<p>I just pulled my batch of these out of the oven.  I don&#8217;t see how anyone could resist tasting them while still warm.  I used 2/3 raspberries and 1/3 blackberries instead of the blueberries (the main eater of the household hates blueberries).  The butter-lemon dough is heavenly whith the warm blackberries.</p>
<p>Wonderful!  Thanks Deb!!</p>

				<p>I was salivating at the pics and cursing the fact that I live in a country with no blueberries, or cranberries, or sour cherries, and scrolling down lists of fruit in my mind to find a potential replacement, when it suddenly hit me: plums. One of my all-time favourite cakes is a Polish plum cake that uses those dusky purple-skinned yellow-fleshed Italian plums that come round every spring. Inspired by this cake, and a general love breads and cakes with lots of fruit in, I tried slicing purple plums (just any old, not the Italian kind) into pancakes. Delectable. Really much like the aforementioned cake. I think they&#8217;d have the same effect on these cookie bars, though I do wonder if the texture would hold up. Will go on the lookout for some plums and start baking.</p>

				<p>First of all, I&#8217;m in love with your site! I have to wipe the drool off my keyboard on a regular basis. The photos of these bars looked gorgeous, but after making them today I&#8217;d have to rate them so-so. They just seemed like they needed more oomph. I even used freshly picked Michigan blueberries from a friend. Maybe a true blueberry fan would feel differently.<br />
Now your smores pie from earlier this summer, on the other hand, was in the top handful of best desserts ever!</p>

				<p>Just made these tonight with berries that were on the bush just this morning. Yummmmmy!  They cut really well, and we enjoyed a still-a-little-warm bar with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream after dinner tonight (as I see others did, as well!).  </p>
<p>Also, like others, I made the dough in the food processor and added a little cinnamon to the blueberry mixture.  </p>
<p>Perfect alternative to making a fussy pie on a hot summer day!</p>

				<p>I made these last night and they were 1.) super easy 2.)delicious!!</p>
<p>I used a mixture of fresh blueberries, blackberries and rasberries to equal the 4 cups because they had all three at the farmer&#8217;s market and I couldn&#8217;t choose favorites. I also used brown sugar in the 2nd mixture instead of white (because I ran out) and that turned out to be great as well.</p>
<p>thanks so much for the recipe, it will be a new staple of mine for parties.</p>

I made them for a labor day bbq and they were a huge hit! My kids also really liked them, even though I have never before been able to get them to eat a blueberry.

				<p>Do you think you could give a tutorial on how to adjust recipe sizes to larger pans or double batches? I have a pan that&#8217;s larger than a 13&#215;9, but am unsure if making like a one plus a half sized version of this recipe would go into it well or just mess it up. </p>
<p>Similarly, I made a double batch of your peanut butter cookies, which was amazingly delicious, but the insides were so soft they fell through the wire cooling racks. I&#8217;ll make the recipe again despite that, and I&#8217;m positive I doubled all the ingredients&#8211;so does size matter? Does making a larger batch of some things throw off the chemistry of the ingredients?</p>
<p>Thanks&#8211;</p>

				<p>Kelly &#8212; If you measured everything correctly and your cookies fell through the rack, either the wires were too far apart for the size of your cookie, or they were underbaked. That&#8217;s the only reason that should happen. As for scaling recipes, there is no reason most shouldn&#8217;t work. However, when considering changing pan sizes, I always like to use the area of the base of the pan for guidance, so the thickness of the cake/bar stays the same. If the base of your pan is, say, 150 percent of the area of a 9&#215;13 (117&#8243;), you want to increase all quantities in the recipe by 150 percent. Hope that helps.</p>

				<p>So, you can use frozen blueberries?  I went to Trader Joe&#8217;s hoping to find fresh and they didn&#8217;t have any!  :-(  I picked up a bag of frozen and I d have some frozen that I bought fresh there just last week. These look great!  I have never posted here before but I come here everyday and and have tried many of your recipes and loved them.  Thank you so much; you&#8217;re amazing!</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t see any reason why frozen blueberries wouldn&#8217;t work. The trick would be if that they let off a lot of liquid (frozen ones are more likely to) to leave it mostly in the bowl, and not transfer it onto the shortbread base. Good luck!</p>

				<p>I just made these&#8211;I did use frozen blueberries, so maybe that was the problem.  Other than that, I followed the recipe completely.  They are OK&#8212;not very sweet.  They need more sugar, I guess.  They look good, but taste more like blueberry bread than a dessert.  This is coming from someone who does NOT like very sweet desserts.  Even my 9 and 11 year old boys were lukewarm about  these bars.  My husband said, &#8220;Maybe you should sprinkle some powdered sugar on them.&#8221;  I make something called a strawberry jam bar which blows these out of the water.  But, hey, I like to try new things.  Thanks for the beautiful photos.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the tips Deb! The blueberry crumb bars turned out really deliciously, though I&#8217;m pretty sure they didn&#8217;t turn out the way your recipe did. My larger pan was only an 11&#215;15 pan, so I&#8217;m betting the bars turned out a little thicker than yours. In addition, I didn&#8217;t have lemon zest so I ended up putting a few teaspoons of orange extract in the dough mixture. It added a hint of orange flavor that really pairs well with the blueberry. They still turned out so wonderful though and I&#8217;m going to have to go get one to eat right now. :) Thanks again.</p>

				<p>They actually turned out just fine even without the egg. I&#8217;ve had no trouble eating half the pan of them by myself.</p>

				<p>Wow. Normally recipes don&#8217;t come out as good as they look (or are promised to taste) in cookbooks or magazines, but these were AMAZINGLY YUM. Thank you times a million. I also pretty much never make things twice, but these are going to be an exception. Clever for thinking of the lemon, it worked great.</p>

				<p>I made these last night&#8211;they were outstanding warm (although molten, which worried me for a while) from the oven but still quite tasty and much more structurally stable from the fridge this morning.  I am taking the remainders as a hostess gift this weekend, but I am terrified to let them come to room temperature before eating, for fear that they will go all squidgy.  Thoughts?</p>

				<p>I am in love!  I found your blog after watching you are Martha Stewart yesterday.  I just made these bars and they are so delicious.  We love to take advantage of the blueberries at the farmer&#8217;s market in the summer.  When they get really cheap we load up and I freeze them in bags so I can use them all year.  They freeze so nicely and there is no need to defrost before baking.  I will definitely make these again and again.  </p>
<p>Have you ever tried them with other fruit?  I am wondering if peaches would be good.</p>

				<p>These turn out exactly as you described!  Tangy, Tart, Sweet&#8230;mmmmmmmm.  It&#8217;s the end of September and I TOTALLY splurged on fresh berries just for this receipe all the while thinking, it better be worth it.  IT SO IS!</p>

				<p>I finally got around to making these this weekend and they are soooo good!   I had a bag of fresh berries mom picked in the freezer and sent home with me last time I was there, and I ended up substituting lime juice just becuase it was what I had on hand. Yum! This one&#8217;s a keeper.</p>

				<p>I made your recipe before with blueberries and they were sooo delicious and incredibly simple. I got so many requests to make them again that I used raspberries for the filling and added some almond paste to the crust. Seriously awesome, and really easy to make multiple variations.</p>

				<p>I made 2 batches of these for a big (informal) dinner and the only disappointment was that there were no leftovers for anyone to enjoy afterwards!<br />
I mixed blueberries and raspberries in about a 40/60 ratio. I used about 900g of fruit per batch and they turned out great. They&#8217;re so easy to make and everyone loves them.</p>

				<p>Just made these with fresh cranberries and orange zest for a seasonal twist on a huge family favorite. YUM. It&#8217;s hard to beat blueberry bars, but these are great too! The red is beautiful at this time of year. My two year old screamed &#8220;BARS!&#8221; when he saw them go into the oven. </p>
<p>Hot tea +  cool cranberry bars = priceless.</p>

				<p>My friend Kat has been raving about your site for a while, so I came here to find a cookie recipe to bring to a dinner party. Requirements: I wanted to make &#8216;em fast (a bar would be better than a drop cookie) and they had to be autumnal. I chose to make a cranberry variation of the blueberry crumb bars. For the benefit of anyone wanting to make them, this is what I did: I used one bag of fresh cranberries which I tossed with a jar of orange marmalade (I use the all-fruit kind), the juice of half a navel orange, and about 1/4 c. granulated sugar. I grated the zest of the whole orange and mixed it into the crust, which was otherwise entirely as written. These suckers disappeared with a QUICKNESS. Success! Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<p>I did as Heather did and made these with cranberries today! I accidentally dumped WAY too much sugar into the fruit mixture, but amazingly the fruit is still mouth-puckeringly tart (which I love, mm!). The only bad thing is that I left it in just slightly too long&#8211;the bottom of the crust is just on the verge of being burnt. Bummer. :( They still taste good overall, but have a slight &#8220;burnt marshmallow&#8221; flavor to the bottoms.</p>

				<p>These look really good, and I&#8217;m just waiting until frozen blueberries go on sale (hehe) to try this recipe. Btw, about how much zest/juice would you need?

				<p>I just made these with a strawberry rhubarb filling. I upped the sugar and nixed the lemon to accommodate the tartness of the rhubarb. I also upped the cornstarch a bit because rhubarb can get watery in my hands. They were excellent. The tart bits of rhubarb were great against the sweet shortbread crumb. I&#8217;ve made them a few times with the blueberry filling and they were also amazing, but I&#8217;m still waiting for blueberry season, while rhubarb and strawberries are in season though I&#8217;ll be making a few more batches of the new mixture.</p>

				<p>I ran out of blueberries while making this (I didn&#8217;t check to see if anyone had eaten them before starting the recipe) and subbed rhubarb.  I didn&#8217;t increase the sugar, but I was already using agave instead (ran out of sugar as well), which might be sweeter by volume than sugar. I kept the amount of starch the same, and the texture is perfect.  The bars were golden and done in 30 minutes, perhaps attributable to the liquid sugar?</p>

				<p>I made these last week for my parents, but made an uh-oh when I went to the store.  For some reason I thought I needed dried blueberries instead of fresh.  When I got home and realised the error, I (luckily) had some Crasins sitting around, so I reconstituted them with the blueberries in hot water for about an hour.  I swapped and orange for the lemon and they turned out wonderful!!  My Mom had me make them again for the teachers she works with before I left for summer classes.  Thanks!!</p>

				<p>I just discovered your site this morning and spent my precious little free time totally engrossed in all your pics and recipes. I love your site! I ran out to buy blueberries and tried this recipe. I substituted King Arthur whole wheat white flour for the regular flour and cut out a little of the sugar since recipes are usually too sweet for me. Unfortunately, the topping and crust did not hold together and came out a little too &#8220;crumbly.&#8221; (My husband and I have still already gobbled up half the pan so it wasn&#8217;t THAT bad.) Have you tried this type of flour with your recipes and was my problem just too little sugar? I&#8217;ll definitely use the full amount of sugar next time now that I know the recipe isn&#8217;t too sweet. Also, I had liquid left over in the blueberry/lemon bowl. Was I supposed to pour that over the blueberries in the pan?<br />
Thanks so much for your site! Susan</p>

				<p>Found your site through Pioneer Woman and have been reading through all your recipes for the last few days. After deciding to make something last night to take into work this morning for my colleagues (its been a looong week!) I realised I had all the necessary ingredients. I swapped the blueberries for frozen raspberries since I had them in my freezer. They turned out beautifully and the first box was gone by 9am! My boss told me to hide the 2nd box so there would be plenty left for the afternoon :) It was also my first experience of baking with cups instead of weighing &#8211; it was super easy!</p>

				<p>I tried yet another one of your recipes (two in one week!) &#8212; thanks as always for sharing :)  For these bars, I 3/4&#8242;ed (is that a verb?) the recipe and used a 9&#215;9 Le Creuset stoneware dish for baking.  The recipe worked perfectly, and the blueberry flavor was not too sweet, and not too tart, which really means it was perfect.  The bars easily came out of the pan after baking one evening, refrigerating overnight, and cutting the next day.  Absolutely perfect consistency all around.  The use of lemon is critical in the recipe, providing a little more zing and flavor.  Thanks again for sharing.</p>

				<p>O.K&#8230;now that I see these came from Allrecipes I know why they looked familiar.  I reviewed this recipe in 2003 and said this:  This recipe is o.k. I didnt really like the crust/topping because it had a shortening flavor to it. I wonder how well it would work with butter, because I think it would dramatically improve the flavor.  I am officially smart.  Not smart enough to fix it myself, but smart enough to figure out the problem anyway.  I will have to try them your way!  The pictures are AMAZING.</p>

				<p>Deb, I made the Blueberry Bars yesterday.  I thought they were a 3 out of 5.  Easy to make, turned out just fine, especially after refrigeration like you said.  I did, however, think that with 2 sticks of butter they might have tasted a bit richer.  I wonder if using brown sugar would spark up the flavor a bit???  I cheated and used my food processor on pulse to work in the butter.  That worked out just great.  Love your site-watched your New York video.  Fun to see you &#8220;for real&#8221; rather than on a blog. Good luck with the soon to be new member of your family.  I&#8217;m a Grandma of two now, but sure do remember the days of little ones with great fondness.  My &#8220;baby&#8221; will be 34 this December!</p>

				<p>I made these for a potluck at work today, and they were a great success. Everyone commented on the beautiful presentation (they really do cut more easily when chilled) and the fresh taste. Very intense blueberry flavor, just rich enough, not too sweet. Delicious! (You received full credit, as usual&#8230;many thanks!)</p>

				<p>I made these last night and they are great:)  I should have left them in the oven just a little longer though, to have a slightly browner crust.  I need to buy a pastry cutter though&#8230;I think that would make it easier.  Thanks:)  I will freeze them too like you mentioned!</p>

				<p>what a great recipe.  i have been thinking about this recipe since you first posted it, but didn&#8217;t get around to trying it until last week.  i wait all year for blueberry season, then tend to eat them non-stop as is, until the season is gone.  however, this was a great use for them.  just the right amount of sweetness.<br />
when i shared this at work, 2 co-workers asked for the recipe, including 1 who admitted that she usually doesn&#8217;t like blueberries.</p>

				<p>Made these before a trip to the beach &amp; in my hurry I forgot the egg! &#8211; Not sure how they would taste had I REMEMBERED the egg&#8230;but they were DELICIOUS. And best served cold, for sure. </p>
<p>Interestingly, when served cold you could really taste the tartness of the lemon&#8230;when served room temp they were much more blueberry-tart :) My family gobbled them up &amp; requested more immediately!</p>

				<p>I made these last night for a party picnic in the park (the philharmonic show) and they were a hit. We hadn&#8217;t even pulled out dessert yet and people were eyeing them. I also love the leftover ones today&#8211;they softened a little from being in a container and taste almost cobbler-ish.</p>

				<p>I made these last night and they turned out awesome, even though I messed up the recipe. I used 3 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries, added the lemon zest to the berries instead of the dough, and mixed the cornstarch and sugar into the berries instead of mixing first and then folding in the berries. Oh and I mistakenly used 1/3 cup of sugar on the berries instead of 1/2. After baking, I stored them in the fridge overnight and for most of the day today. Despite all this, they looked and tasted great. Thanks!</p>

These are unbelievably delicious! Thanks so much for posting the recipe.<br />
I plan to make these again substituting different fruit. Can&#8217;t wait to try with strawberries and one with peaches.<br />
I added a little bit of cinnamon to the blueberry mixture and added some cinnamon and cardamom in with the crust mixture.<br />

				<p>Omg.  I just made these.  They sliced beautifully and I couldn&#8217;t even wait for them to cool&#8230;I used slightly less than 4 cups of blueberries.  Perhaps this is why. Can&#8217;t wait to try them cold as they are fantastic warm.  And I&#8217;m one of those freaks who prefer blueberries raw&#8230;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these several times now (there&#8217;s a batch in the oven as I type), and they&#8217;re excellent; easy, too! They travel wonderfully well, I&#8217;m making mine for a work function tomorrow.</p>
<p>I HAVE made these with Tart Cherries and they are Phenomenal. Picked the cherries right off the trees, pitted and made this recipe to test them out. I omitted the lemon zest/juice, and subbed in 1 tsp almond extract in both the crumb base and the cherries, and used ~3/4 c of sugar. I took them to work (gleaning tart cherries for our food bank, actually) and they disappeared in minutes. Lots of thumbs up and compliments. I passed along your wonderful recipe and website to those who asked.</p>

I read in the comments that you used UN-salted butter rather than the regular variety &#8212; wish I had known that before I started baking &#8212; my results could&#8217;ve been even lovelier! Any chance you might change the post to specify the type of butter??  In any event, thank you for sharing your recipes and all the hard work that goes into those gorgeous pics too!</p>

				<p>This has been my go-to recipe all summer and everyone has loved it! But, in late August, I swapped the blueberries for peaches and added a hearty splash of bourbon instead of the lemon juice. The lemon zest came out of the crumb mix and I added some fresh nutmeg and a smidge of cinnamon. They were really fantastic  and it&#8217;s nice to have such a great, malleable recipe&#8212;thanks!</p>

				<p>hi deb! i don&#8217;t recall if this is the fourth or fifth recipe I&#8217;ve now made from your site, but every one has been stellar, including this one&#8230;</p>
<p>i did make one change to your recipe but only because I was going away and needed to empty the fridge&#8230; instead of just blueberries, i did a mix of blueberries and peaches&#8230; </p>
<p>so regarding the change I made, i still had four total cups of fruit&#8230; after peeling the peaches (via the immerse-in-hot-water-for-a-few-seconds method), i diced them and tossed them in with everything else the blueberries were mixed with, plus two extra teaspoons of cornstarch, since peaches can release a lot of liquid when baking&#8230; i let the mixture stand as I prepared the crust and topping as I knew the peaches would release some juice&#8230; i used a slotted spoon to transfer the fruit on to the crust&#8230; i sprinkled just a bit of the fruit with the juice left in the bowl (there was at least a cup!)&#8230; i was trying hard to avoid over juicy and hence soggy squares &#8212; and I was successful!</p>
<p>the result was super yummy and a delicious treat on our first family road trip with our five month old son maxence&#8230; my parents and my son&#8217;s godparents got a taste before we left and they were all swooning with delight&#8230;</p>
<p>thank you again for another terrific recipe&#8230;</p>

				<p>Cranberry version:</p>
<p>I made these with blueberries several times this summer and they were great. </p>
<p>This weekend we were going on a pick nick with some friends, so when I started thinking about an appropriate autumn treat, cranberries, of course, were the first thing that came to mind.</p>
<p>I got two 12 oz packages of cranberries and a couple of meyer lemons. Cooked cranberries with  some water and about a cup of sugar (I like cranberry feeling extremely tart, so you might want to add sugar to taste) for about 5 minutes. When the feeling cooled, it thickened. I threw in a couple of handfuls of chopped roasted pecans and just a bit of lemon juice, to thin the feeling. Zested one lemon and the zest to Deb&#8217;s short bread recipe. </p>
<p>Except for the feeling, I used Deb&#8217;s recipe for these bars. With cranberry feeling, they are out of this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Try it!</p>
<p>Thank you, Deb for the recipe and inspiration.</p>

				<p>I made these with cranberries for a quasi-thanksgiving feast, and they were quite good. I used orange and lemon zest and just a pinch of cinnamon in with the cranberries. This is definitely a wintery treat, and living on Cape Cod means there are cranberries everywhere!</p>

				<p>Hi, I plan on making these later today but I only have frozen blueberries.  Can someone tell me if I&#8217;m supposed to thaw them first or can I use them as is&#8230;frozen?  Thanks &#8211; can&#8217;t wait to try this one!</p>

				<p>Well..I finally made these today.  Son called this A.M. in a panic needing something for a potluck at noon.  Blueberries? For a Christmas potluck?  Yes.  Definately.  They were a snap to put together and tasted wonderfully fresh and summery.  Everyone loved them and I loved them, too.  Kind of went with the sunshine we had today!  Oh, and I found out that the 4 tsp of cornstarch worked perfectly to firm my juicy, previously frozen berries.  Great recipe find, Deb.</p>

				<p>These. Are. Amazing.  I&#8217;ve made them a bunch of times and everyone always loves them.  I&#8217;ve tried making them with whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I personally didn&#8217;t like them, but several of my friends thought they were even better than the regular ones.</p>

				<p>I went blueberry picking and we bought 5 kgs of blueberries and they were sitting in our freezer so i decided to give this recipe ago. The lemon scent is so divine. It&#8217;s really subtle, and brings out the flavour of the blueberries. I watched it bake quite carefully. It only needed about 40 minutes in my oven. For the last five minutes I turned the heat down to about 100 and put it on fanbake because the top was browning so quickly. The frozen blueberries give off a lot of syrupy goodness, so I cut a slice while it was hot, and drained out all the excess liquid to prevent it from becoming a soggy mess. Thanks heaps.</p>

				<p>I did have one problem though, it seemed like the cornflour was a bit concentrated in some places, creating an odd white gloop between the blueberries. How do I fix this?</p>

				<p>If you skim the comments (or do a word search for frozen) it looks like many people have tried these with frozen. For the most part, it seems to work but frozen do tend to give off more water&#8230; some extra cornstarch or draining may help.</p>

				<p>Just made these to bring to Easter dinner&#8230;and a corner of the pan is already missing!!  Very good!  I made the following modifications based on what I had available:<br />
I used frozen berries (maybe 3 cups).  I took them out of the freezer when I started prepping and added the lemon juice/cornstarch mixer to the frozen berries.  I upped the cornstarch to 5 tsp and the bars weren&#8217;t soggy, nor did the crust turn out purple.<br />
I used 2 c. white flour, 1 c. white whole wheat flour..about 2/3 c. vanilla sugar and 1/3 cup brown.  Mixed everything in the food processor (I&#8217;m lazy that way).  Topped it all with some raw sugar &#8211; added a nice crunch to the top.  Thought they were quite yummy &#8211; definitely adding this to my go to recipes.  Might add a little zest to the blueberry mix next time&#8230;</p>

				<p>I made these delish bars last night in efforts to throw an easy post-dinner sweet together and they were perfect! I added chocolate chips to give it a little something extra &#8211; my husband and I enjoyed it right out of the oven like a warm cobbler and just now as the traditional crumb bar &#8211; yummy both ways! Thanks for this great recipe!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m making a springtime version of these- strawberry rhubarb- yum! I love this recipe and I&#8217;ve used it often. However, this time I&#8217;m making them for a larger group and I wanted to double the recipe and bake it in a sheet pan. Should I change the temperature and increase the baking time? Or can I leave the temperature the same? Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

				<p>I made these yesterday morning. Before I went to the gym I macerated a bag of frozen mixed berries with the half cup of sugar and some vanilla instea of the lemon/cornstarch route. To please my kids I mashed the berries too and the whole family loves them!  Thanks so much for being such a dependable resource!</p>

				<p>I made these an hour before our cheer banquet and cut and stored them after just a couple of minutes in the fridge- the heat in the container made them so moist and delicious and wonderfully, slightly warm :].  Our cheerleaders are known for their love of food, and the bars vanished instantly, with many, many complements from the stuntmen.</p>

				<p>As the &#8220;moral officer&#8221; at work (read: person who provides delicious baked goodies), I brought these in last week, and they were a huge hit!  Even those who claimed they didn&#8217;t like sweets had several.  I&#8217;ve already received requests for cherry, peach and, of course, more blueberry!  If you&#8217;ve tried these with any other fruits, I&#8217;d love to know how they turned out.</p>

				<p>I made these today to bring to a barbeque, but they didn&#8217;t come out as expected. The top crumbs were almost burnt in a 375 degree oven in less than 30 minutes while the bottom was soggy; and the whole thing is just too jiggly to be cut into bars. We ate it cobbler style with ice cream and it was tasty, but any advice on what went wrong and how to fix it?</p>

				<p>OH MY GOODNESS. Okay, so I just took the firsst bite of this and WOW it is soo delicious! I&#8217;m not really sure how i can&#8217;t go in for another piece. It tastes like blueberry pie, but with a better crust and not so runny. Oh how i wish i had some ice cream for this because that would just push it over the top.</p>
<p>Oh and baking note: I cooked these for about 35 minutes and am so glad that i checked on them then because I think they would&#8217;ve been too dry had i baked them for another 10 minutes.</p>

				<p>Delicious! I brought them to work and they were a huge hit. I was really worried that the crust wouldn&#8217;t turn out properly because I had a heck of a tough time cutting the butter in with a fork (note to self: obtain pastry knife ASAP), but they turned out beautifully. (I left them in the oven for an extra 8 minutes or so to get them to brown on top). I&#8217;ll definitely be making these again. Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d had these in the back of my mind ever since I discovered your site in December&#8230;as soon as I saw blueberries, I was on it! Everyone loved these, like a blueberry crumb pie in bar form. I cut half of them into little two-bite bars, froze them, and am bringing them to a 4th of july party this weekend, perfect!</p>

				<p>I made these on Monday using blackcurrants rather than blueberries, because that&#8217;s what I happened to have on hand. They&#8217;re fantastic &#8211; I&#8217;ve kept them in the fridge and it&#8217;s only now (Thursday morning) that they&#8217;re starting to soften a bit. Can&#8217;t wait to try a blackberry and apple version in late August when my blackberries are ripe, and then the  cranberry / orange version at Christmas.</p>

				<p>These are so good!  Really, a pie that you can bite into!  So fresh.  And something that any baker can add her/his own thing to in order to &#8220;personalize&#8221; it.  Next time I make these, I just might add sliced almonds to the crumble that goes on top. Mmmm.  I know Deb hates the food processor for cutting butter into flour, but perhaps when her hands are a little more &#8211; shall we say &#8211; weather worn, the push-of-a-button ease will call to her.  I used my fp and the crumble was fine.  Took just 42 mins in my oven to get golden brown.</p>

				<p>Hey Deb!! This is way late but just wanted to say thanks for this &#8211; took these bars to a July 4th fireworks-watching party&#8230;and the people?? Well, they just loved them. This has been on the list of dozens of Smitten Kitchen &#8220;must make&#8221; recipes that I catalogue at home. SO glad I finally did. Amazing and came out perfectly &#8211; didn&#8217;t need any extra oven time at all! Thanks!</p>

				<p>Made two batches of these last weekend for a cook-out and a party that we were invited to celebrating July 4th. They were delicious, and very easy to make. I did half brown sugar/half white, and added some cinnamon (maybe about two t?) to the blueberry filling mixture as some had suggested above. Not sure if either mod made much difference, really, but at any rate they certainly were good. I&#8217;d make them again for sure. Next time saving more for myself, of course.</p>

				<p>Found this recipe 3 hours ago.  I mixed up the crumbs in my Kitchen-Aid (perfect!), went out to my backyard and picked 4 cups of blueberries.  I added a little vanilla and almond to the blueberry/lemon mixture.  They came out of the oven at 44 minutes and they are heavenly.  And I thought I had a good blueberry bar recipe; this tops all.  thanks!</p>

				<p>Oh Deb, these are amazing.  My brain was so overwhelmed!  I kept thinking &#8220;these taste like blueberry muffins!  but they are bars!  except it is coffee cake!  but these are BARS!&#8221;  Oh, everyone that tried these (I brought them to work, shared with friends &#8211; oh I was so magnanimous) ooohed and aaaahed over these, just as they should have.<br />
When summer comes and I have fresh produce in abundance (we do a CSA) you are my go-to girl. Thanks.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
Oh, this is my new favorite blog!!! I just found it last night and couldn&#8217;t sleep thinking about waking up and running to the store and making both the apple cake and blueberry crumb.  I decided on the blueberry crumb.  I know it is going to be fabulous.  Because I am a crazy cinammon-pecan crazy person, I added just a touch of cinnamon in the crumb mixture and sprinkled chopped toasted pecans with a little brown sugar on top of the crumb mixture before baking.  Yummy!  Thank you.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
I&#8217;ve been a fan since I came across this site last fall, but this is my first time posting.  I just made the blueberry crumb bars yesterday and they turned out great!  I added a dash of cinnamon to the blueberries and only ended up baking them for about 30 min (my oven runs pretty hot).  They&#8217;re even better today after being in the fridge all night.  I can&#8217;t eat them all myself (or at least, I shouldn&#8217;t), so I&#8217;m going to be a very popular person at work tomorrow!  Thanks so much!</p>

				<p>Just made these tonight&#8230; they turned out great!  I used lime zest and juice instead of lemon, which worked out well, and frozen berries instead of fresh (trying to empty out the freezer before I fill it up again with this summer&#8217;s berries!).  I did throw in a little extra cornstarch to balance out the extra juiciness from the frozen berries.  Super good!</p>

				<p>I am sitting here at 10:00 at night in Washington State for the first time in a couple of years. last time I was here was to attend Ammachi&#8217;s Seattle Retreat. Such Bliss. This year I am here looking for a place to live with my sis and we are house-sitting. Tomarow is a Celebration of the Hindu holiday, Guru Purnima. Seattle Satsang and all her Glory will be celebrating one of the nost Famous Satgurus of India&#8217;s history. AMMACHI! I wanted to bring something very special and different to celebrate, and I just popped it out of the oven. It looks Heavenly, smells divine and after reading all of these comments, I am sure to see smiling faces when I show up at The Seattle Satsang&#8217;s special potluck tomarrow. This dessert Is gonna be DELISH for DEVI!!!<br />
THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!</p>

				<p>This was an amazingly easy recipe, truly a snap to make and they turned out to be  almost as beautiful as the pics.  A word of warning , though, to people with a sweet tooth.  These seemed more like breakfast pastry to me than dessert.  I would significantly increase the sugar if I were to make them again.</p>
<p>The little parchment holders looked elegant, were very helpful keeping fingers clean,  and were  much-commented-upon by guests.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m no baker, and I found making these to be super easy.  The bars turned out wonderfully when I followed the recipe to the letter&#8211;I did use a small lemon, though, and next time (and there will definitely be one!) I think I&#8217;ll use a bigger one or the juice of two to get a little more lemon flavor.  Thanks so much for the great recipe&#8211;I&#8217;m off to explore the rest of your site!</p>

				<p>I love your OCD-ness with the little wax paper pieces for each bar. :) Also, I laughed out loud at &#8220;Hmmph! The natives are getting restless.&#8221; I think you&#8217;re channeling my grandmother&#8211; and that is definitely meant as a compliment!<br />
My husband loves these, but my sister-in-law goes ga-ga for them, so naturally, I make them whenever she visits. I&#8217;ll be making them this weekend with fresh-picked berries and I&#8217;m sure everyone, especially her, will rejoice.</p>

				<p>I made this yesterday and was left a little disappointed. to be honest. Surprisingly my picky boyfriend doesn&#8217;t seem to share my criticism. So maybe it&#8217;s just me?<br />
The blueberry layer has a gel-like consistency and the crumb layer is rather tasteless. I used a little less sugar than the recipe calls for and 1-1/2 sticks of butter instead of two. I&#8217;m not sure sticking to the recipe would have changed the outcome? Sorry, Deb &#8211; I love all your other recipes that I have tried!</p>

				<p>these were so beautiful when i pulled them out of the oven&#8230;the smell in the kitchen had my two girls going nuts&#8230;we were going to be patient and cool them to take them as dessert at a neighbors later that evening but could not resist and plunged right in with a fork&#8230;they were so good warm&#8230;that we reheated them at a very low temparture after dinner and served them with homemade vanilla bean ice cream&#8230;..what a treat and a very big hit&#8230;</p>

				<p>I just made these yesterday and they were great! I was looking for a simple summer treat to make for my family and friends, and they were exactly what I was looking for. I compared your recipe to the original All Recipes version, and knew yours would be what I was looking for. I kept hearing from people that they looked &#8220;expensive&#8221;, it&#8217;s nice that they weren&#8217;t though. Big bang for my buck!</p>

				<p>Depends on where you are. In the UK and Australia, what we call &#8220;cornstarch&#8221; in the US is labeled as &#8220;corn flour&#8221;. But here, corn flour is typically flour made from corn, and not just the starch of of it (which is flavorless). In general, if you can get arrow root powder, it is interchangeable with corn starch in recipes. At times, potato starch is too.</p>

				<p>Made these the other day! Went down well! I used wholemeal flour and cutting the butter in was taking forever so I added a tablespoon of melted butter and it brought it together. I also had no corn flour so used plain flour and it worked fine. WIN<br />
Next time will try blueberry and orange and cut down on the sugar a bit. Would this change the texture too much?</p>

				<p>I went out and bought unsalted butter for this recipe, and arrived home to find I&#8217;d been too forgetful to buy a lemon.  I nixed the idea of using limes as too strange (I wish I&#8217;d read all the comments; I love Froot Loops!) and instead used bottled lemon juice and Boyajian lemon oil.  My bars came out slightly bland with a floor-polish aftertaste.  (seriously, nothing I&#8217;ve ever put lemon oil in has ever come out well)<br />
The bars are delicious when sprinkled with kosher salt, and I think (at least for my tastes) they&#8217;d be much better with salted butter.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!</p>
<p>I made these last week for a family get together and the bars looked and tasted amazing!I sprinkled them with cinnamon before putting them in the oven and also decorated them with a thick lemon glaze once cooled to RT. </p>
<p> I am new at baking and I have used your website twice for recipes, and both times it has been a wonderful experience. Thank you so much for sharing your recipes, you truly are an inspiration for me :)</p>
<p>For the bars, my sibling are not big blueberry lovers, and when they ate the bars, they found them to be a bit too tart. But when they had leftovers 2 days later and loved them! It seems that leaving them in the fridge for 24-48 hours makes the bars soft and chewy. </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

				<p>I just made these tonight and they were absolutely perfect in every way! I didn&#8217;t find them too sweet at all, and was expecting them to be more tart from the comments, so I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t add more sugar. I did use frozen blueberries, since that is what I had on hand and they turned out great. I will be making these all the time and they will be a regular staple recipe for me! I felt like I was eating something from a bakery. I did have to bake them about 10 extra minutes. This is the first recipe I have tried from your blog&#8230;I will definitely be back for more.

I did let my mizer do the work of mixing the dough. I just used he dough hook and used low while I was mixing the blueberries. This time I made them I used parchment paper in the pan for an easier clean up. And they still came out delicios! I think I am going to try some other fruits. Love these!</p>

				<p>I didn&#8217;t have enough blueberries, so I subbed part blackberries.  The bars turned out beautiful and smell divine, but the bottom crust is kinda dry and tasteless.  They weren&#8217;t overdone, they are just kinda blah.  The lemon flavor didn&#8217;t really come through and what I thought would be a tender shortbread bottom is closer to a powdery russian tea cake (don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like RT cakes). Kinda disappointing.</p>

				<p>These were excellent! We used frozen blueberries without a problem. Didn&#8217;t have a lemon on hand, so used bottled lemon juice and had no lemon flavor, so I guess I didn&#8217;t use enough. They still went over very well with the family!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a blueberry lover and I have TONS of blueberries right now sitting in my freezer. Can I use frozen blueberries for this recipe? The frozen one seems to have more liquid than the fresh one, so do I need to add more cornstarch?</p>

				<p>I seem to have lost my sweet tooth! The original recipe was far too sweet, so I halved the sugar in the crumb topping and nixed it in the berries. Still too sweet. I&#8217;m thinking one third cup sugar in the crumb topping the next time :O I also reduced butter by a quarter, and substituted half almond meal and a quarter ground oats for the flour, and the crumbs still came together nicely.</p>

				<p>I know this is an old post, but I wanted you to know how I used it, and how wonderfully it came out.</p>
<p>I took this recipe, as well as a recipe for lemon bars and combined them. I halved the sugar in this, as ash did, and before putting on the crumb topping, poured homemade lemon bar filling (VERY tart, because lemon things can NEVER be too tart for me) over the blueberries. </p>

				<p>Made this over the weekend with strawberries (blueberries at this point would have cost me $24 for the amount needed in the recipe ~ yikes!) and oh boy ~ you weren&#8217;t kidding when you said these were great and nearly any berry will work.  Will definitely try this with MANY varieties of fruit.  YUM!</p>

				<p>I love this!  I found that blueberries can get kind of pricey so I substituted strawberries and orange zest and they came out great :)</p>

				<p>I made this and your mom&#8217;s apple cake for dessert for Easter, and my oh my,they were wonderful!  I used frozen blueberries since fresh ones would have cost me $30-$40!! I didn&#8217;t drain them (I forgot) but I didn&#8217;t find them liquidy at all.  I froze half of them so i&#8217;m hoping they hold up well this week!  Thanks for another amazing recipe!</p>

				<p>It may be 306 calories a bar (if you cut it into 15), but I still eat it! Delish! My bars came out wonderfully. Eat cut was clean because I placed it in the fridge before cutting. I wrapped each square in parchment paper, and they went fast.</p>

				<p>I tried these &#8211; they were delicious!  But just wanted to note the changes that I made:  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar of the quantities mentioned in the original recipe.  Also, I added a cup of oats to the dough and used 1 1/2 stick of butter and 1 Tbs of oil (instead of the 2 sticks of butter).  It turned out great!</p>

				<p>I made these yesterday in my 82 degree kitchen. I guess the recipe was just that compelling. They were quick and easy (so I could retreat back into an air-conditioned room shortly) and came out just as beautifully as yours did! My butter, of course, was in no way cold, but I stuck the bottom layer of crumb in the pan in the freezer, and and then chilled the rest in the fridge before putting it on top of the blueberries. Thanks for this recipe! It&#8217;s a keeper :D</p>

				<p>I was planning on making your peach shortbread &#8211; but my peaches went mouldy. So I made these instead, using a pile of stewed apples instead of the blueberries, and adding some rolled oats and cinnamon to the portion for the top. It&#8217;s lovely! I look forward to trying again with blueberries.</p>

<p>Thanks for your great blog-it&#8217;s my absolute favorite-going strawberry picking this coming weekend and can&#8217;t wait to make that cake of yours!!</p>

				<p>This has become my go-to recipe for spring and summer picnics.  I made it for Easter brunch, the teachers&#8217; luncheon, and again today for the Brownie scout picnic.  Perfect!  Cooks up great with either frozen blueberries or fresh, by the way, no problems.  Oh, and I forgot the egg until after the cake was assembled &#8211; but I beat the egg with a little of the topping scraped off and poured it over the top and couldn&#8217;t tell in the finished product.  I love a recipe that is so forgiving!!  Thanks.</p>

				<p>I made this last year on my yearly visit to South Carolina and now im back again, they are the best thing you will ever taste&#8230;. I change mine up a little by adding brown sugar instead of white sugar and i add a little more lemon to the crust and topping, i also ad a little bit of oat meal to the topping&#8230; its the best</p>

<p>I also made the chocolate sorbet last night and it was gorgeous (I had it for breakfast as I just couldn&#8217;t wait)!</p>
<p>Another thing, your cheese straws! I grew up on these as I live in the UK, the smell evokes so many childhood memories, specifically of doing some day-day shopping with my mum :)</p>

				<p>Tammie &#8212; Potato starch and/or arrow root powder are usually good cornstarch substitutes. In this case, however, you could also use flour, but I&#8217;d probably double it.</p>

				<p>Thank you so much for this recipe! I made it last night with what I had on hand &#8212; blackberries, and a little balsamic vinegar in place of the lemon, though I still wished I&#8217;d had a lemon for the zest.

But my DH came back from the supermarket with a bag of them to use (I said &#8220;any frozen berry&#8221; and apparently, he doesn&#8217;t have ESP) . So, I cooked them in about 1/3 cup sugar first, let them all soften, and then mixed them with blueberries (also frozen). I used a bit more sugar than recommended, to soften the bite of the cranberry. In all &#8212; PERFECTION. Seriously, they were the perfect summer treat &#8211; not too heavy, not to sweet, but just indulgent enough. Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>Made these twice and both times they&#8217;ve been devoured. The second time I only had one pint of blueberries so I used a pint of strawberries as well. These bars are definately a keeper.</p>

				<p>These are SOOOO delicious! I agree with one of the posts, that I needed an extra 15 minutes in the oven, at 45 minutes they were way too pale, and not golden enough. I baked them for 63 minutes and they looked great. I wonder if maybe these should be cooked at 400, so they brown easier? I may try this next time when I make them.</p>

				<p>Also, it would be nice if people did not post until they make them. Yes they look great &#8211; but its not useful feedback to say &#8220;wow I cant wait to make these&#8221;. I much rather read peoples commentary on it.</p>

				<p>Wow &#8230;. this will be my go-to recipe for blueberries from now on.  A great hit at work late last night.  The filling is nice and moist and very flavorful.  DIdn&#8217;t get as much of the lemon flavor coming through as other posters did but it certainly enhanced the blueberry anyway.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these as written a number of times and they have always turned out very tasty. The last time I made them I replaced 2/3 cup of flour with a 2/3 cup of graham cracker crumbs which made them stay crispy in the fridge overnight and added a lot of flavor to the crust. </p>

				<p>Just stumbled on this recipe today. And just receiving 3 pints of fresh blue berries I feel compelled to use another of your recipes knowing it will be good.. They are in the oven now baking up. I can not wait to sink my teeth into these bars. Thanks Deb for all the great recipes, I always know where to direct my browser for something new, refreshing and delicious :)</p>

				<p>Just made these and they turned out perfectly! I only had 2 cups of blueberries and I think more would&#8217;ve made them a little too..berryish (Blasphemy, I know). The crust was terrific! Not too soft and not too hard; they were pretty easy to cut up after cooling.</p>
<p>Thanks for this recipe!</p>

				<p>I just got back from Wolfeboro, NH where they make a blueberry crumble tart with a shortbread crust at Stellaloona Bakery. I live in Seattle. This bakery is too far away to deal with my cravings. Happily I found recipe for blueberry crumble bars. I will be trying to get something close to what I had back in my stomach ASAP. Thank you!!</p>

				<p>These squares were amazing. I had to bring them into work so that I wouldn&#8217;t eat the whole pan. I followed the recipe exactly as you wrote it. Amazing!</p>
<p>Also, I have to admit I was greedy, and I did not wait for the squares to cool before cutting them. The squares didn&#8217;t look very square-like, but my coworkers didn&#8217;t really care because they were SO GOOD.</p>

				<p>three years later and this is still our favorite end-of-summer treat! however, I&#8217;ve made a dangerous discovery&#8230; our plethora of blueberries actually was gobbled by an obsessed toddler, so I had to reach into our freezer for most of the berries in the recipe this time around. frozen blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries made a totally amazing batch of these in a pinch—which means that we might just be making these all year long.</p>

I am studying abroad right now in Italy, of course there is a ton of food inspiration around me but on rainy days like today nothing makes me feel better than baking some American classics! This recipe was wonderful given my limited appliances (no kitchen aid :( ) and ingredients (who knew oats were so hard to find in italy?). Please post more recipes like this!</p>

				<p>Whoa! My son sent this recipe to me today after just sending a text saying simply, &#8220;Blueberry crumb bars&#8221;. Do you think he&#8217;d like me to make some? Subtle hint I would say,wouldn&#8217;t you? Of course I asked him to send it along via email. Great site, I&#8217;ll have to scout around a bit.I have also been into All Recipes many times.I would like you to know I am here if you ever need another sampler to help you!

				<p>I always make these in the summer and made a fall version this weekend- 2 cups each of chopped pears and cranberries (halved), an extra tablespoon of sugar with the fruits, 1 less teaspoon of cornstarch, and replaced the lemon in the recipe w/ orange.  Turned out sweet and tart, perfect.  Thank you for the recipe!</p>

				<p>best recipe ever! this is my 4th time making it in a month and everyone cant seem to get enough of it! but i put less sugar and i substitute the blueberries with pears. this is one hard recipe to make it exactly like the picture. everytime i made this, none of the times did the crumbs look the same. sometimes more hard and sometimes its just one clump and i would have to pinch it or dice up the batter. but overall, this is a great recipe if done right! =)</p>

				<p>Hi, I&#8217;ve been reading and cooking your recipes, and loving your blog for weeks now.Made these yesterday and was amazed at the emmediate rush for more. I used salted butter so added just a dash more, frozen blueberries with an extra tsp of cornstarch and a blend of lime/lemon juice and zest. The blueberry flavor sparkles, so much so I just had to say thank you. Thank you!</p>

				<p>OH MY LORD. Currently eating my results. My brain is giving this recipe a 10 out of 10, but my stomach is giving it a 12 out of 10. It&#8217;s tangy and sweet and a little bit salty tastes mix together in beautiful harmony. I replaced 1 of the cups of blueberries with 1 cup blackberries, which I think made it each more dimensional and perfect. Such a great recipe Thanks!</p>
