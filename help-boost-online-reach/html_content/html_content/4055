Supporters of President Hosni Mubarak attacked protesters in Cairo’s Tahrir Square on Feb. 2. Mubarak announced in a televised address the previous night that he would not run for another term in office, but would stay in power until elections later this year. Demonstrators were not satisfied by his avowals, and did not heed calls by the government and military to cease their protests. <br />

Pro-Mubarak forces stormed Tahrir Square wielding rocks, knives and Molotov cocktails. Some anti-Mubarak demonstrators  tried to flee, while others responded by throwing rocks and trying to otherwise overwhelm the pro-Mubarak groups. Pro-Mubarak forces also allegedly dropped stones from the buildings surrounding Tahrir Square.

Anti-Mubarak demonstrators outnumbered their attackers, but were not equally prepared to fight. Some pro-Mubarak supporters arrived in Tahrir Square on Feb. 2 riding horses and camels, while anti-Mubarak protesters were forced to fight back with their bare hands.<br />

The attackers in Tahrir Square on Feb. 2 are not the only Egyptians who support President Mubarak. After more than a week of continuous protests that have brought the country to a halt, some Egyptians have called for a return to normalcy, while others have argued that the president should be allowed a dignified exit.<span class="smallgray"></span>

has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011128222033802146.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that he plans to
dismiss the government on Saturday, but it's not
clear that this is enough to calm the throngs
of protesters still demonstrating in Egypt's streets across the calling
for Mubarak's removal. There are still conflicting
reports as to where the country's military stands: Reuters <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE70R2DR20110128" target="_blank">reported</a> Friday evening that the Army has taken control of
Cairo's main Tahrir Square and dispersed the gathered crowds. Here, a demonstrator throws a fuel bomb at anti-riot police vehicles in the northern city of Suez on Jan. 28.

in the protests. While the estimated number of demonstrators in Cairo only
reached several thousand, demonstrators greatly outnumbered police.

Protests continued into the evening in central
Cairo, as demonstrators faced down security officials' batons, water cannons
and tears gas for hours.

Mubarak has relied on security forces to maintain
order to an extraordinary degree throughout his rule. Yet today's protests were
the largest and most organized civil unrest the police have had to face in decades.

Protesters expressed their anger at their country's
endemic corruption and shambolic economy, as well as the lack of free and fair
elections. &quot;Where are you freedom?&quot; protesters in Ismailia <a href="http://www.iloubnan.info/politics/actualite/id/54964/titre/Thousands-protest-in-Egypt-against-corruption-and-economic-policies" target="_blank">shouted</a>.

Tahrir Square, the main site of protest in Cairo -- the
capital's hub of political and economic life, as well as the most popular area
for tourists -- was chosen for its symbolic resonance. Above, demonstrators

<p>I hope you're right.  The entire world is pulling for liberty and freedom from oppression for the Egyptian people.  We also all know that there are anti-democratic Islamist elements in Egypt, who may be minorities but who make up for their minority status with fanaticism.  These zealots are going to represent a problem for any future Egyptian government. Denying their existence is not going to make the task of seeing that they are proportionately represented in a democratic system, when they care nothing for democracy or for other people's liberty.  </p>
<p>I hope you break Mubarak's chains on Egypt. I also hope that Egyptians are sufficiently realistic, to know, from the beginning, that if they fail to deal appropriately with their native Islamist fanatics, their fate will be as bad as that of the long-suffering Iranian people.  Good luck.</p>

       <p>The US Government should shut up and let the Egyptian people decide their own future without undue meddling by the US in Egypt’s internal affairs.  Our government should abandon its hypocrisy when it comes to the Middle East. The US Government can’t pontificate about the virtue of democracy only when it involves Iran and China, while biting its tongue when it comes to criticizing the Middle East dictators who were the creation of our own CIA. </p>
<p>The Muslim brotherhood is an integral part of the fabric of the Egyptian society, like it or not. The Brotherhoods are no more fanatical than Evangelical Christians, the like of Pat Robertson, Rod Parsley, or John Hagee who mentored and supported the Regan and G.B. Bush Administrations. The Brotherhoods are, definitely, less radical than many Jewish Rabbis, the like of Meir Kahane, Manis Friedman, Ovidia Yosef, Yosef Eltizur, Yitzhak Shapira who were very influential in the Israeli society and governments. The Brotherhood never advocated the murder of people they disagree with, contrary to their fanatical Christian and Jewish counterparts. </p>
<p>The Israeli lobby, which controls our Congress and Mainstream media, wants us to make enemies of 1.3 Billion Arabs and Muslims, and thus gives justification to Israel to kill more Palestinians and steal more of their land.  It is time for the USA to stop trashing its democratic ideals, just to please the Israeli Lobby.</p>

       <p>This revolution was completely set up and backed by the united states. It's a shame how Hezbollah, hamas, and al Qaeda have given the brotherhood a bad name. If somebody could tell me the last time the Muslim brotherhood blew somebody up I'd like to know. Mubarak has been sending illegal arms and materials across the border through all those networks of tunnels he has, giving them to Lebanon, and the palestinians while shaving some off the top for himself. Since the clinton administration through the bush and now Obama admin they've all wanted him to step down. The Israelis are puting on one hell of a show with their concerned rhetoric, but it allows them to save face. The Iranian and Syrian governments are the ones who need to be concerned for this is the domino affect we wished for two years ago in Iran. What we need to be concerned about is this revolution being highjacked by Islamic terrorists such as the 1979 revolution. I doubt it will happen in Egypt, seeing as though their military has the full backing of the united states' military. Remember, the united states gives about 2 billion in military funding a year to the Egyptians.</p>

IS THIS MERELY THE END OF ANOTHER NEW BEGINNING?<br />
James Houle, Editor</p>
<p>Most revolutions over the past 50 years, whether in Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Libya, or even China have not been very thorough:  they have seldom really thrown the bums out. Promising beginnings certainly, but usually ending in a mere reshuffling of the same old deck: replacing obviously corrupt cabinet ministers with a few new faces. The Cedar Revolution in Lebanon (2005) threw out the  tattered remnants of the Syria's Army brigades that had earlier suppressed Lebanon's civil war (with USA approval), but then left a Sunni/Christian minority in power led by the late Rafik Harriri's inept son Saad. Algeria's Marxist government replaced the French colonialists in 1962 but has gradually drifted back to a corrupt oligarchy, severely suppressing popular Islamic parties and the minority Kabylie people.  Nasser's Pan-Arabism was seduced by the almighty dollar under Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak and remains, at least until today, a client garrison state of the United States and the defender of Israel's southern flank. Libya threw out their aging King Idris in 1969 and installed the autocrat Omar Ghadafi who writes obscure pseudo-religious pamphlets and wanted to live in a tent while in New York for the recent UN conference. He dropped his tiresome anti-West platform after Ronnie Reagan dropped a few bombs on his family tent, and the US/UK insisted he cough up two Libyans that they could pin the Lockerbee disaster upon, despite much evidence to the contrary. Now Ghadafi is merely eccentric Uncle Omar, working hand in glove with western oil companies, keeping his small population quiet, and regretting Ben Ali's overthrow in Tunisia.  </p>
<p>An Aborted Beginning in China<br />
I witnessed first hand the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square back in 1989 when the police and municipal authorities were essentially driven from power by the students. Within days after the massacre on June 4th, the Chinese Communist Party (CCCP) was back in charge and Mao's paint-smeared portrait thoroughly cleaned. All student demonstrators were identified and thrown in prison.  Congo's “President for Life” Joseph Mobutu was overthrown in 1997 after 35 years by Laurent-Désiré Kabila.  An entire plane-load of US State Department and Pentagon worthies immediately descended upon Kinshasa carrying suitcases full of greenbacks and broad smiles so as to assure that this seeming revolution would be friendly to the interests of our mining corporations. </p>
<p>And Now Tunisia and Maybe Lebanon?<br />
Just last week, our Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, dropped into Tunis and spent two days discussing who might be an acceptable replacement for the dearly departed President Ben Ali, who was still fastening his seat-belt for the short flight into exile in Jeddah. “We have heard the voice of the Tunisian people loud and clear” Feltman trumpeted. It is widely reported that the US had already advised the Tunisian military to withdraw their support for Ben Ali, leaving the President no choice but to call good old Saudi King Abdullah for an invite. A cosmetic cabinet shuffle was effected, leaving real power in the hands of the same dog robbers. We do not know whether the crowd on the street will grow tired and accept this fix. Rachid Ghannouchi, head of the banned Nahda Party, and still under a life sentence imposed by Ben Ali, has now returned from a 22-year exile but seems reluctant to lead. If things will just quiet down a bit in downtown Tunis, Feltman and the Quay D'Orsy (French foreign office) can get on with their work.  </p>
<p>Our Assistant Secretary Feltman did much the same work, behind the scenes, in Lebanon back in 2009. Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton et al. that patch-up has just fallen apart as a result of open elections that replaced Saad Hariri's government with a coalition that holds a majority of the seats in Parliament, and includes the Hezbullah, the Druze and even a group of Christians and. The US and the French have worked tirelessly behind the scenes, placing scare stories in the American press about how Hezbullah will now attack Israel, something they have never attempted nor even espoused. President Obama, encouraged by AIPAC (American Israeli Political Action Committee) is threatening to cut off all US aid to Lebanon. Pleas to Israel to give UN sappers maps that locate the four million US-manufactured cluster bomblets that they left scattered around the villages of southern Lebanon upon their departure in 2006 have been ignored.   </p>
<p>To Control or Merely To Kill?<br />
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Bill Clinton's grizzly old National Security Adviser, wrings his hands at all these 'Global Political Awakenings' and bemoans that: “In earlier times, it was easier to control one million people than to physically kill one million people; today it is infinitely easier to kill one million than to control one million.” Always there with a happy twist, old Zibby. (Global Research 01/27/11). Are we really seeing the beginnings of a new 'global awakening'? Given how many revolutions have been choked with butter and bucks, the upheavals in Egypt and Tunisia could just as well be the end of just another hapless beginning. After all, the United States strategy of democratization in these countries often consists of “creating the outward visible constructs of a democratic state (multi-party elections, an active civil society, 'independent' media etc.) and yet maintaining continuity: subservience to the World Bank, the IMF, multinational corporations and the Western Powers.” (Global Research 01/27/11).  Joe Biden is so confused by all this he's not sure whether Mubarak is really a dictator. (01/27/11 Lehrer News Hour).</p>
<p>Mubarak Shuffles the Deck and Digs In<br />
Mubarak has appointed a new prime minister Ahmed Shafik, a long-time deputy of Mubarak with a reputation for toughness. The new interior minister, former internal-security chief Gen. Mahmoud Wagdy, was Egypt's top jailer. Robert Fisk, writing for The Guardian (01/30/11), describes the new Vice President Omar Suleiman as “an elderly (75) apparatchik.” Jane Meier in her book “The Dark Side,” explains that since 1993 Suleiman headed the feared Egyptian general intelligence service and was the C.I.A.’s point man in Egypt for renditions—under which the C.I.A. snatched terror suspects from around the world and turned them over Egypt for brutal interrogation sessions. Military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Anan, another who has worked hand in glove with the US, fortunately was in DC when the shit came down in Cairo. Obama's people undoubtedly advised him of what we considered the military's appropriate response to the revolt.  </p>
<p>The US press is filled with dire warnings about what would happen were the Moslem Brotherhood to seize power. Mohamed ElBaradei and others find this fear of the Brotherhood to be a myth. He explained that the Brotherhood spoke for a small minority in a country which does not have a strong attachment to moslem fundamentalism. Nevertheless, it has served as an effective fear-producer with the American public that has been fed a daily diet of such propaganda about 'Islamic fascists' ever since 9/11. Another fear tactic used to justify a serious crackdown upon demonstrators is the threat to private property by looters and armed gangs.  Al Jezirah reported that in Tunis, Ben Ali had sent security police in plain clothes to loot and to encourage others to loot in Tunis. The Mubarak regime was reported by Stratfor, MSNBC, and Al Jezirah to have had a hand in the looting in and around Cairo.  The security police (SCP), abandoned their task of assuring law and order when the crowds became too large, but are still equipped with guns. MSNBC's Richard Engel also reported on Meet The Press (01/30/11) that the regime 'allowed' thousands of prisoners to escape from prison as a means to show the public what chaos could result were the Mubarak government forced from power. The major US TV networks have reported looting by armed mobs and criminals in the past week without ever mentioning Mubarak's hand in this.   </p>
<p>Clearly caught by surprise at the strength of the protests, the US has seemed  a mere spectator. Press Secretary Gibbs has urged that Mubarak conduct “meaningful negotiations with a broad spectrum of the people”, something Mubarak has not done in his 30 years of power. Thee Obama administration claims to have nurtured contacts with various Egyptian opposition groups although Gibbs admits we have had no contact with the most vocal opposition party, the Moslem Brotherhood, nor with Mohammed El Baradei, former head of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and a possible future President. Now we see Mubarak trying to save his government even if he must resign. Obama and Clinton have not exactly urged his resignation. A means of transition has not been defined and they may very well fear that the public out on the streets will not accept a new government consisting mostly of the old faces Mubarak has announced.  </p>
<p>The army was called out when the Central Security Forces (CSF) had obviously lost control to the mob. Now that the army has refused to take sides and instead seems even friendly to the demonstrators, it is reported  (STRATFOR reports 01/30/11) that Mubarak has redeployed the CSF. This could result in major bloodshed. Many plain-clothed police were filmed and broadcast internationally just last week beating up demonstrators. Baradei has appeared on the street and has offered to head a transition government leading up to the elections scheduled for next fall. The Moslem Brotherhood has been reluctant to take the lead themselves, after a long history of suppression, jailing, and even murder by Mubarak's people. </p>
<p>The US maneuvers for position so that they may subvert and control whoever next comes to power. Former US Ambassador Frank G. Wisner (1986 to '91) was dispatched to Cairo “to reinforce the US message to Egypt” according to Gibbs, who was careful not to define that message.  After all, someone had to give the bad news to Hosni Mubarak: that the US Magic Carpet is being withdrawn. This back channel visit well illustrates how the US tries to direct the transfer of power within its client states. Real democracy is the usual casualty. Robert Fisk laments (Guardian 01/30/11) “the lines of power and the lines of morality in Washington fail to intersect when US Presidents have to deal with the Middle East.” Mubarak seems unwilling to step aside. This makes it more difficult for the US to continue to prop up the established order in Egypt. Stay tuned.</p>

       <p>Most Egyptians (Muslims and Christians) pray on daily basis, so this image represents a normal pray time for most of Egyptians that has no relation to the Muslims Brotherhood Organization. I was one of the people that was praying here with 10s of my friends and family members, and all of us were praying although nobody of us is member or even knows a member in such organization.<br />
Actually the Egyptian govt. and the Dictator always create a bigger picture for the Muslims Brotherhood Org. more than reality in order to give himself a legal reason to suppress Egyptians and scare the EU, UN and the US with a fake enemy called Muslims Brotherhood Org.<br />
This image shows pure Egyptian protesters without any Organizational or Political party introduction that fight for their freedom against the dictator who rule Egypt for 30 years now.</p>

       <p>Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is not as bad as many western ppl think , although i'm not a big fan of them but the truth that even when 3 Egyptian presidents imprisoned ,tortured and executed many of the they never went to violence , I guess this bad image is manly made by Mubarak's regime to till the west that the change is evil. They are at least better than the tea party in da Us or the settlers' parties in Israel.</p>

    <div class="comm_body">
       <p>My last trip to Cairo was one in which I was afraid for my life a fair portion of my visit.  I was there to teach the Government workers how to apply for USAID grants for food for the Egyptian people.  The Government assigned three guards carrying AK-47s to watch over me and I rode around in an armored car the whole time I was traveling in the country.</p>
<p>I almost got into trouble while shopping at the Bazaar in Cairo because at the local mosque they had a talk on brotherhood.  When 40-50 men came pouring out of the mosque they all began to pick up stones and I watched from the safety of my vehicle while they stoned a Brit, who was there shopping for gifts for his family.  Also during my trip another Brit was fire bombed for no reason other than he was a foreigner.</p>
<p>Personally, I was glad that the Government (Mubarak's) had provided the guards to protect me.  I was very sad to learn months later that the officer in charge of my protection detail was murdered after I had gone back to the U.S.</p>
<p>Violence for any reason hurts your cause - doesn't help, because when you are violent I just want to treat you like a snake and chop your head off.  You can justify violence - doesn't matter if you are poor or mistreated by your government.  That doesn't give you the right to hurt others.  Thank God I live in the U.S.A., where I can carry a gun to defend myself and if a demonstrator throws a stone at me or a fire bomb, I can shoot and kill him.</p>

    <div class="comm_body">
       <p>If you've ever been to Cairo, you won't be surprised by this uprising. The country has been so poorly run for so long, and its people victimized for generations. This is what happens when a country is run with a miliatry mentality. When you see the stark poverty level many millions live with in Cairo, you realize that Mubarak does not even have the good sense to understand the importance of maintaining the population at a reasonable sustanance level...to preserve his own position! Could he really be that stupid? He apparently does not even understand he has undermined the stability of both the country AND HIS OWN WAY OF LIFE!</p>
<p>He lives like an emperor, and could care less about his own people. I am more surprised this did not happen earlier, but it probably took so long because the Egyptian people are among the kindest and most generous I have ever met. Also interesting is the role that twitter &amp; texting played as the ideal tool to mobilize the populace. The rest of the world is taking notice, and more upheavals like this are bound to follow.</p>
<p>The worst is yet to come, but this had to happen. Oil prices will climb, and the Middle East will further destabilise. This event also flings open the door for a new regime, that might just have is praying...God forbid...for the return of Mubarak...nobody can say. But America should STAY OUT OF THIS!</p>

       <p>It doesn't ultimately batter what US politicians say. America has become a nation of spies... The spies will do what their misinformation tells them to do —  the world will only learn of their machinations five years down the road, when we are sifting through the wreckage of poor people's democratic dreams.</p>
<p>I agree, "America should STAY OUT OF THIS!" but which America will show up?</p>

       <p>Hey friend . You have misunderstood me .Definitely you have the right to know and give your opinion and no one could deny it . I just oppose the foreigner countries which give such interference and tell us what we should do .<br />
Egyptians know many things no one could know by surfing some websites on the internet .<br />
There is a great plot and great ordeal .<br />
I think we are qualified enough to solve our interior problems . we don't need any help.</p>
