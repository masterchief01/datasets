<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/07/blueberry-boy-bait/" title="blueberry boy bait"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2516/3693813053_19a0039a21.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="blueberry boy bait" /></a></p>
A few weeks ago, as <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/06/strawberries-and-dumplings/">I was going on about</a> how much I like just about every color and shade of baked fruit desserts, the goofier the name &#8212; be it &#8220;grunt&#8221;, &#8220;slump&#8221;, &#8220;buckle&#8221;, or &#8220;betty&#8221; &#8212; the better, a reader named <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/06/strawberries-and-dumplings/#comment-296003">Shirley</a> asked me if I&#8217;d ever tried anything called Blueberry Boy Bait.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3693775565/" title="batter up"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2573/3693775565_89f9ecc4d6.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="batter up" /></a></p>
<p>And people, seeing as I unabashedly choose magazines for their covers and fawn over the titles of books (&#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159448306X?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=159448306X">I Was Told There&#8217;d Be Cake</a>,&#8221; anyone?) that I have no interest in reading, let&#8217;s just say that although I had no idea what Blueberry Boy Bait was, I knew it would be made, in my kitchen, sooner than soon. [Well, actually I'd bookmarked it for August, when I believed blueberries to be in season, only to find them at my local greenmarket four days later where I proceeded to <i>plotz</i> from happiness. Bring on the boy-baiting!]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3654660271/" title="eee, blueberries!"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3664/3654660271_0d3e46ae21.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="eee, blueberries!" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3693777823/" title="south jersey blueberries"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2660/3693777823_6397f6b641.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="south jersey blueberries" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-3774"></span></p>
<p>I mean, seriously, Boy Bait could have been blueberry gravy for meatloaf, garlic-pickled blueberries for a potato salad or any other unforutnate-sounding blueberry concoctions (though I now suspect it&#8217;s just a matter of time before someone emails me a blueberry gravy or pickled blueberry recipe; go on, bring it on, I guess I asked for it) and I probably would have still made it because: <b>boy <i>plus</i> bait</b>. If nothing else, the story would have had a great title.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3693780025/" title="boy baiting"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2498/3693780025_e37255e9fc.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="boy baiting" /></a></p>
<p>Fortunately for all of us, but I&#8217;d say mostly Alex, me and the friends I fob my baked goods off on, Blueberry Boy Bait is delicious, a buttery, rich single-layer cake studded with fresh blueberries and swaddled in a sheet of cinnamon sugar. In fact, if you&#8217;ve been hanging around here for a couple months, you might even note its resemblance to a certain <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/05/raspberry-buttermilk-cake/">Raspberry Buttermilk Cake</a> so let me be quick to point out what makes it noticeably different: It&#8217;s the butter. There&#8217;s a lot more of it. I&#8217;d dare say there&#8217;s so much more that cake is almost <i>more buttery than it needs to be</i> but I know that would be just impossible. Implausible. Or at least that&#8217;s what the boy in <i>my</i> house said before he reached for a second piece. Thus, I guess it worked.</p>

<b>Two years ago:</b> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/eyes-wide-open-all-the-time/">Rosanne Cash&#8217;s Potato Salad</a>
<p><b>Blueberry Boy Bait</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.cookscountry.com/recipe.asp?recipeids=3546&#038;bdc=42552">Cook&#8217;s Country</a>, which adapted it from the original</p>
<p>Like any recipe with a great name, this also has a great story, which was that in 1954, a 15-year-old girl stole the show (but only won second prize) in the junior division of an early Pillbury Bake-Off with a variation of this recipe, named, she said, after the effect it had on boys.</p>
<p>Cook&#8217;s Country magazine dusted this recipe off from the Pillsbury Bake-Off Dessert Cookbook and made a few tweaks to bring it more deliciously into the modern age: butter was swapped for shortening, the quantity of blueberries was doubled and some plain sugar was replaced with brown sugar. The result? Let&#8217;s just say you don&#8217;t need to be a boy to be lured in.</p>
<p>Serves 12, generously</p>
<p>2 cups plus 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour<br />
1 tablespoon baking powder<br />
1 teaspoon table salt<br />
16 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened<br />
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br />
1/2 cup granulated sugar<br />
3 large eggs<br />
1 cup whole milk (though buttermilk, which was all I had on hand, worked just great)<br />
1/2  cup blueberries, fresh or frozen (if frozen, do not defrost first as it tends to muddle in the batter)</p>
<p><u>Topping</u><br />
1/2 cup blueberries, fresh or frozen (do not defrost)<br />
1/4  cup granulated sugar<br />
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p><u>For the cake:</u> Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 13 by 9-inch baking pan.</p>
<p>Whisk two cups flour, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. With electric mixer, beat butter and sugars on medium-high speed until fluffy, about two minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until just incorporated and scraping down bowl. Reduce speed to medium and beat in one-third of flour mixture until incorporated; beat in half of milk. Beat in half of remaining flour mixture, then remaining milk, and finally remaining flour mixture. Toss blueberries with remaining one teaspoon flour. Using rubber spatula, gently fold in blueberries. Spread batter into prepared pan.</p>
<p><U>For the topping:</u><br />
Scatter blueberries over top of batter. Stir sugar and cinnamon together in small bowl and sprinkle over batter. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in pan 20 minutes, then turn out and place on serving platter (topping side up). Serve warm or at room temperature. (Cake can be stored in airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.)</p>

				<p>My mom has been making a version of this forever! It is one of her regular desserts. Her&#8217;s has more of a crumbled layer of cinnamon sugar on top, much like the top of a coffee cake. America&#8217;s Test Kitchen also did a recipe with this same name earlier this year.<br />
It is not blueberry season here in the northwest but we are knee deep in raspberries. I will soon be making your buttermilk cake with fresh raspberries. Can it possibly be better than making it with home grown frozen berries? We shall see!</p>

				<p>dear goodness this looks brill.  I have to make cakes for lots of gatherings and have many variations on yoghurty blueberriness (yes it is a word) and this will just add to the repetoire. cheers</p>

				<p>Ms Deb, you and I are scary on the same page.  First, the watermelon lemonade, now this?  I started my post on my own boy bait last night.  And while everyone loves an everyday cake, I opted for Nigella&#8217;s boy bait&#8211;baked custard, quick blueberry jam, and meringue.  Boy bait Brit-style, if you will.  </p>
<p>All I can say is that I hope that all this like-mindedness doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m pregnant too.  Like I really need an excuse to eat my weight in cake.</p>

				<p>Yay&#8230;some friends of mine here in NC have blueberries growing in their front yard, and I was blessed with about 2 cups of fresh blueberries.  Since I don&#8217;t really like to just eat blueberries but prefer to eat them baked into something delicious, this recipe comes at the perfect time!  All I need is some milk (I&#8217;ve been out for days), and this cake is mine.  And I suppose I can use it to &#8220;bait&#8221; my husband.</p>

				<p>this is my mom&#8217;s recipe! well, not hers originally, but a classic in our family&#8230; </p>
<p>as i&#8217;m a single lady, my roommates were confused by the name and thought i was making it to attract the gentlemen. nono, it&#8217;s just delicious and so easy for so much goodness. :)</p>
<p>i add lots more blueberries to mine, and mix them in the sugar and cinnamon before putting them on top of the batter. and i&#8217;d definitely recommend trying other fruits, as well!</p>

				<p>Wow!  That looks like a pretty thick batter!  The slices shown look to have a great crumb, but the blueberries look like they may have sunk to the bottom.  Did they or was it just the ones that happen to be in the photo?  I like that there aren&#8217;t so many blueberries in this cake.  Some recipes load in too much of a good thing or am I just getting minimalist in my old age?</p>

				<p>This name had me giggling!  I&#8217;ve been wanting to make the raspberry buttermilk cake so badly and haven&#8217;t gotten around to it.  I actually thought about cutting some of the sugar so I could eat it for breakfast :-)  But I think this just bumped its way ahead, purely for the name!  I think I&#8217;ll sub in some other berry, though, because I&#8217;m not much of a blueberry person, nor is the boy I plan to bait!</p>

				<p>Love, love, love blueberries.  I have a couple of friends who give them to me every year if I&#8217;ll just come pick them.  I&#8217;ve already made one trip.  Got a couple more to go.  Cobblers, buckles, doughnuts, cakes&#8230;love them all with blueberries.  But I&#8217;ve got to admit I&#8217;ve never heard the term boy bait associated with food.  Wow.  That&#8217;s really funny!<br />

				<p>This looks fabulous!  Hmmm, I think I could serve this for supper with some scrambled eggs and iced coffee, don&#8217;t you think?  We JUST found affordable blueberries (about $2 a pint, previously only seen for more than $10 a pint) here in my home in Asia, so this recipe looks like a great way to eat them!  Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>Susan &#8212; They sunk a little but I completely forgot to toss them with the flour leaving me to wonder if that&#8217;s what caused it or if even that teaspoon couldn&#8217;t have saved them. The blueberries are definitely on the sparse side &#8212; I might not even have minded more, but there was something nicely balanced about this.</p>
<p>Kim &#8212; Yes, now fixed.</p>

				<p>Miss Deb -</p>
<p>I got a version of this off the internet about a year and a half ago and have been making it madly.  The internet version has about 1/3 less butter and, you drop the bluberries onto the batter &#8211; like with your raspberry cake.  It is light yet flavorful and divine.  Anyway, it is such a fab cake, how could one more verison of it be bad?</p>
<p>Plus, feel no shame for a weakeness for things containing the word &#8220;cake.&#8221;   There&#8217;s a diner we go to because on the weekends, before your get your meal &#8211; you get cake.  And my poor husband knows, I wriggle in my booth, I stretch and squirm until I can be sure &#8211; yes.  They have cake.  The sheet pan is out of the oven and is being sliced, and all is well with the world.</p>

				<p>All I can say is thank you.  I just made this and it is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.  I&#8217;ll probably have to run about 5 miles tomorrow to make up for the amount of cake I consumed, but it&#8217;s so worth it.  I guess I should be mad at you for introducing this to me, but I&#8217;m just in a state of euphoria.  I did skip over the part about the 13X9 pan and was confused when everything started pooling out, but my only loss is a good bit of deliciousness and a clean oven.  Don&#8217;t judge, it&#8217;s late.  Thank you so much for posting this Deb!</p>

				<p>I made the blueberry (or raspberry) buttermilk cake that&#8217;s been making the rounds lately, and I think all of us jump for something so easy and delicious.  I can SEE the butter on this one, and agree with you&#8211;there&#8217;s hardly such a thing as too much.</p>

				<p>i got teased at the grocery store for buying the two pound container of blueberries, but when i got home from work, this recipe was waiting for me! my house smells like heaven now, and the cake is wonderful.  i used soymilk because that&#8217;s what I had, and it probably turned out a little bit more crumbly than yours, but i have no doubt it will be consumed. thanks!</p>

				<p>Yum. YUM YUM!!  I made the cherry brown butter bars (to wild acclaim) over the July4 weekend and was going to make them _again_ with blueberries but this is very very very tempting.  Especially with buttermilk.  Every baked good made with buttermilk is wonderful, and (IMO) substituting buttermilk for whole milk is never wrong.</p>

				<p>I have been making a version of this for 25 years!! But mine is called blueberry buckle and uses only white sugar, with a sugar/butter/flour/cinnamon crumb topping. I have no idea where the recipe came from, but it is my all-time favorite summer recipe. I always have the ingredients on hand this time of year, since blueberries are plentiful in the northeast. FYI, I bake mine in a round springform and cut it into wedges to serve (with homemade vanilla ice cream of course)</p>

				<p>Oh no&#8230; another recipe I need to make! You&#8217;re killing me! What do you do with all of your baked goods? Or perhaps a better question is, how do you bake so much and not have a heart attack from butter overload? I made two baked goods over the weekend (your cherry brown butter bars and some blueberry oat scones) and I already feel like there is way too much in the house.</p>

				<p>did you use baking soda instead of the baking powder b/c you used buttermilk or did you just sub out buttermilk and nothing else? It&#8217;s almost blueberry season here so this will be good bait for convincing the boy and our little girl to pick lots of blueberries.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb &#8211; I starting making this when I saw it in Cook&#8217;s Country and honestly it is the most popular dessert I&#8217;ve ever made.  (Yes, including World Peace Cookies.)  I double the blueberries, and never bother to dust them with flour &#8211; always turns out fine.</p>
<p>BTW &#8211; I make this off season, using frozen blueberries, and it is great.  I&#8217;ve also made it several times with other frozen berries &#8211; also great.  Just an all around great recipe, big hit with everyone.</p>

				<p>I made this back when the recipe first came out in Cook&#8217;s Country, and loved it, but then promptly forgot about it!  So, thank you for reminding me, and I have 3 pints of blueberries in my fridge right now, thanks to a $0.99/pint sale at a new grocery that just opened, so I will be remaking this tonight!</p>
<p>Speaking of the Raspberry Buttermilk cake, thank you, thank you, thank you.  I have made it twice now and it is simply divine.  Light, fruity, with a little bitey, citrus zing&#8230;a perfect summer cake.</p>

				<p>Blueberries are one of my favorite fruits, so I am hoping to get some blueberry bushes for my yard next year.  It would be great to go outside and pick blueberries during the summer for a cake or a pie or just because.</p>

				<p>I love this. Love the title. Love the story Love the way it looks. I&#8217;ve literally spent all of monday thinking about this &#8211; enough to come back to it today. </p>
<p>Believe you me, it&#8217;s been mentally added to my to do list. I&#8217;m pretty sure a gluten-free version (and maybe a wee bit less buttery version??) of this cake will be baked in my kitchen, boy or no!</p>

				<p>@ECJ, I was just about to ask the same thing! :) None of our business really, but if it is true &#8212; ultra-cute way of revealing it.</p>
<p>I read &#8216;I Was Told There&#8217;d Be Cake&#8217; and was less than impressed. I just feel like there&#8217;s better out there of the same quirky short-story genre, i.e. Sarah Vowell.</p>

				<p>This cake is delicious.  I have made it before and everyone always loves it.</p>
<p>I also made the raspberry buttermilk cake for Memorial Day but put blueberries in it along with the raspberries.</p>
<p>That was another delicious cake.</p>
<p>My daughter loved your pepper salad.  Wants me to make it agian and loved the idea about soaking the red onions in the vinegar and water to make them milder.</p>
<p>Thanks for so many good rfecipes.</p>

I remember it as being VERY yummy-will make soon.  Thanks for the memory.</p>

				<p>This looks excellent.  I must confess that I have made the Raspberry Buttermilk cake a bunch of times (with blueberries) and it was beyond delicious.  I once made The Raspberry Buttermilk Cake and accidentally added twice the amount of butter.  It was still yummy and I suspect a little more like this Boy Bait cake!!  </p>
<p>I wish &#8211; so dearly wish &#8211; that I had the recipe for an old Newfounland recipe that my grandmother used to make called Blueberry Grunt. My mother says that it was never written down, but I will continue to search, because it was so satisfying&#8230;..</p>
<p>Until then &#8211; thanks for continuing to be such a fantastic source of inspiration.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb &#8211; did you also make the blueberry/cinnamon/sugar topping? Your earlier comment seemed to refer to the blueberries in the batter, which sank a bit. But the photos don&#8217;t look like there was any of the topping. Or did that sink, too? In any event, this looks like a perfectly yummy breakfast (lunch, snack, dessert) cake.</p>

				<p>Hi, Deb &#8211; I finally had to comment when I saw this one. I recently went through my grandmother&#8217;s old cookbooks and recipe files. She went to culinary school and was fabulous in the kitchen, but we never got the chance to cook together. What was the first recipe index card I pulled out and giggled about to my mother?? Blueberry Boy Bait!!!! Absolutely making it now that it&#8217;s been SK approved. Thank you!!</p>

				<p>I popped this in the oven before making dinner tonight.  Hubby &amp; I each enjoyed 2 squares right after our meal&#8230;not at all usual for us&#8230;but restraint was not possible.  I&#8217;m already contemplating a big slab with a dollop of Greek yogurt for breakfast.  This is going to be a very strong rival for my grandmother&#8217;s berry crumb squares&#8230;shhhh.</p>

				<p>My Mom has the orginal Bake-Off book that the recipe was in.  I remember looking at it many times but never made it, since Blueberrries (in the 60&#8217;s) were difficult to find in any grocery store in my area.  We (my boyfriend and I) are going to Michigan to pick blue berries as soon as they are ready.</p>

I am SO excited you&#8217;re going the surprise route!  We did the same and likewise for most of my pregnancy people around me were 100% confident it was a boy.  We kind of just started thinking it must be true.  Our girl is now almost 14 months old!  That moment of surprise when she was born &#8211; the anticipation of finding out!  SO. Worth it!  Planning be damned!</p>

				<p>Well Deb, you have become the Go-To person for me. I watch a number of shows,  read cookbooks, and am known as a good cook amoung my friends and family.  I woke up yesterday and saw there was a new posting for this delicious sounding cake.  It was another rainy, gray day here in Boston and I whipped it up and carted it into work warm. WOW! DEElicious! A big hit, and verrry easy to make. I always give your site credit.  Thanks again!</p>

				<p>I saw this on Cook&#8217;s Country and tired it 3 times (I&#8217;ve used fresh, old starting to wilt, &amp; frozen blueberries); I always get good feedback but the cake never looked tall and fluffy like on tv, however I am happy to say that my cakes do look like yours so maybe I am doing something right.  Thankx!</p>

				<p>Hey deb, mine is in the oven as I type.  I flavoured it with lemon as I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be so excited about the cinnamon flavour.  Just added rind to the batter and the sugar topping.  Will let you know how it turns out.  Smelling pretty fine so far&#8230;</p>

				<p>OMG &#8211; So, I&#8217;m cruising through my news feeds this morning when I see the title &#8212; Blueberry Boy Bait. </p>
<p>Hello! Screeching halt. Anything with &#8220;boy&#8221; and &#8220;bait&#8221; in it has to be made. My boy&#8217;s getting luuuucky! ;-)</p>
<p>Um, I wandered over here from PW after your visit. Just so you know. And like Sarah, I smiled over the buttermilk remark. Cheers.</p>

				<p>Delicious! I just ate a little piece still warm from the oven. And a poll of the boys in my house made it unanimous. I added a little bit of vanilla paste to the batter just because I can never leave well enough alone. This recipe is a keeper ;)</p>

				<p>Nice! I just put mine in the oven. No fresh blueberries thought, here in Mexico they&#8217;re hard to come by, so I used frozen ones. I&#8217;ll go check on it in 20 minutes or so. (The batter tasted yummy, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll turn out great!)</p>

				<p>Sarah &#8212; Was wondering when someone was going to smirk over that. My fridge is abnormal. My whole kitchen is. You should have heard me last week when I was getting ready for that morning show and they asked if I could bring serving bowls and I was like &#8220;I really don&#8217;t have any&#8221;. Seriously. I have two, at best. It&#8217;s always been enough. They probably now call this Stingy Kitchen.</p>

				<p>Great recipe &#8211; results are light and fluffy!  I too substituted buttermillk.  I thought the blueberries looked rather sparse, so added 1/2 c. of frozen raspberries into the batter and 1/2 c. on top with the blueberries.  Cut out 2 Tbl of butter, only used 1/3 c. of granulated sugar and 2/3 c. of brown sugar&#8230;.still came out delicious and sweet!</p>

				<p>Yes! I totally made this the other day. The Ladies Guild of Newport Rhode Island claimed it as their own sometime in the sixties, and then I found their <i>Recipes from Newport</i> fundraiser book and tried it myself. My fiance and I ate the whole pan ourselves in a single day! </p>

				<p>substitute rhubarb for the blueberries and you have Moon Cake&#8212;lovely bumpy top.  I&#8217;m still using my rhubarb, and will switch to blueberries later in the summer.  And, I&#8217;m a sucker for clever wine bottle labels&#8212;the bottles just jump into my basket.</p>

				<p>Made this last night and it was fantastic!  I used heavy cream instead of milk (muahahaha), baked it in an 8&#215;8 pan instead of the 9&#215;13, and then proceeded to eat half of it.  The 8&#215;8 took about 8-10 minutes longer to bake and I only needed half the cinnamon sugar mixture for the top.  It came out tall, rich and delicious &#8211; that&#8217;s good bait! ;o)</p>

				<p>Made this today and it was fabulous  but I used frozen blues which were ok to use according to the recipe but they sank. They were very large berries and I coated them with flour as suggested but still, they all wound up at the bottom&#8230;even the ones I put on top! I&#8217;m thinking that because they were frozen, they were too heavy in the batter&#8230;any thoughts?? BTW, great , great cake. Will make again !!</p>

				<p>I made this today and like Kookie in London, my first instinct was to add lemon zest to play off the extreme buttery-ness. I added the zest of a large lemon before folding in the blueberries. Also made the topping with half turbinado sugar, half regular sugar to add a little more crunch to the crust.</p>
<p>Despite a thorough flouring, most of the blueberries (fresh) sank to the bottom and probably contributed to the cake sticking to the pan pretty badly when I flipped it over. Next time I&#8217;ll probably try the round springform pan that someone else mentioned.</p>

				<p>So I may have substituted dark brown sugar for the light the recipe called for&#8230;&#8217;cause it was all I had. No harm there.</p>
<p>And I may or may not have thought about replacing some of the blueberries with some fresh raspberries I snatched up at the market, and then right before putting the pan into the oven I simply added them in addition to the cup of blueberries already called for. Definitely no harm there either.</p>
<p>What a delicious (and equally dangerous! I believe I baited myself&#8230; I&#8217;ll be bringing most of this into work tomorrow!) recipe, thanks for sharing. Your articles are always exciting to read and it actually inspired my foodie roommate and myself to create our own &#8220;eating blog.&#8221; Many thanks!</p>

				<p>Thanks for this one, I usually boycott any recipe calling for sticks of butter (as I&#8217;m too lazy to look up the metric conversion) but this just looked too good to pass on. It deserved fresh blueberries, but even with frozen ones it was so light, fluffy and delightful. The kids loved it too once they got over their disappointment that the dark stuff wasn&#8217;t chocolate, but yuk &#8211; fruit!</p>

				<p>Made this yesterday for a casual dinner with visiting relatives. It couldn&#8217;t have been easier, and was absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>I baked it in an 8&#215;8 pan and a loaf pan because I wanted a square cake and didn&#8217;t want to convert the amounts (or end up with less cake). We did gild the lily and serve it with a dollop of whipped cream, but it certainly didn&#8217;t need it. </p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve heard it makes a pretty good breakfast, though I have no personal knowledge of this&#8230;.</p>

				<p>This was a lovely little recipe that whipped up in no time!  I added 2 cups of blueberries and used a mix of AP &amp; cake flour, which made the cake more delicate but still delicious.

I have received such love for so many of your recipes (the chocolate peanut butter cake made their jaws drop to the floor, and I swear it was gone in, er..like 15 minutes!), I just had to pass one of those big hugs on to you :)</p>

				<p>This is in the oven as I&#8217;m typing! I made it with frozen blueberries (we ate all the fresh ones from the yard) and in one 8&#8242;x8&#8242; and one 9&#8242; pyrex pie dish. It looks great and I can&#8217;t wait til the timer goes off in five minutes. Thank you so much! You&#8217;re recipes are always so delicious(:</p>

				<p>Great recipe! Made it today and used evaporated milk, since my only fresh milk was skim. It turned out wonderfully! I also didn&#8217;t bother dusting the mixed-in blueberries with flour. It seemed (and proved to be) an needless step.</p>

				<p>mine is in the oven as I type, as well. I used reduced fat buttermilk (all I had), added a handful more blueberries (I have 2 lb tub!) and accidently added 1/2 c sugar for the topping, managed to blow a lot off (ha!) so we&#8217;ll see. I also used turbinado sugar for the topping instead of white.</p>
<p>Smells delicious! I&#8217;m excited :) And so are all my boys!</p>

				<p>Definitely this would be girl-bait (or rather, me-bait) but unfortunately, in this household, blueberries are the death knell for my boy (he&#8217;s allergic, and will go into anaphylactic shock). I know it&#8217;s really weird. But I love him anyway.</p>

				<p>I made this tonight. It&#8217;s very tasty, but all the blueberries sunk to the bottom of the cake, and it stuck to the pan pretty badly (I buttered the pan and sprayed Baker&#8217;s Joy). I don&#8217;t know if it would have affected anything, but I didn&#8217;t have whole milk or buttermilk and used 2% instead. It tastes really good but isn&#8217;t the prettiest thing I&#8217;ve made.</p>

				<p>i made these last night for breakfast/ friday office breakfast club. it is so moist and very tasty. some of my berries sunk but the top ones made dimples and the sugar caramelized and made a crispy top. cute and very yum. i had it while it was warm. perfect! it&#8217;s been a long time since i used a 13*8 cake pan. Thanks to you, none of my baking pans ever felt lonely.</p>

				<p>The night I read this post, I made it. For breakfast &#8211; I would NEVER eat at 10:00 p.m. Heh. Well okay. Maybe I do. On occasion. Sometimes.<br />
Anyway.<br />
Of course I had to make my usual substitutions. All whole wheat pastry flour, raw sugar. It was excellent, though the blueberries sank to the bottom. Perhaps I need a thicker batter&#8230;<br />
Thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>I had to wait an extra day to make this, because I didn&#8217;t have enough butter in the house. But I made it last night, and it was delicious warm. It&#8217;s still delicious at room temperature. I just don&#8217;t have a platter big enough for it, so it was a bit messy during the flip. We ate the ends that fell off, and decided those calories didn&#8217;t count.</p>

				<p>The name caught my eye and the ingredients caught the attention of my taste buds.  :)    Made this yesterday after work in the 9 x 13 pan and, with only 2 of us here, it&#8217;s almost half gone already!.   Since I had already eaten all the blueberries in the house, I used fresh raspberries from the bushes in the back yard.  The cake is sooooo rich and delicious;  I&#8217;ll be trying it again with blueberries.</p>

				<p>What a great name for a cake. This cake reminds me of a cake my friend&#8217;s Czech mother used to make, except hers had a streusal topping. I&#8217;ve been hankering after blueberry cake lately. Now I now what to do with all the blueberries I plan on picking next weekend.</p>

				<p>Smitten, I made this yesterday and had a few troubles. In short, it kind of fell apart coming out of the pan and being flipped back to right-side up on the platter. Also, all my blueberries sunk to the bottom. The taste, however, was marvelous.<br />
Any ideas why things went (slightly) awry?</p>

				<p>Made it today &#8211; I just had a little corner, we haven&#8217;t had our official dessert yet. Delicious!  My batter didn&#8217;t seem as thick as yours does in the picture, I did use whole milk instead of buttermilk, don&#8217;t know if that made a difference, and my blueberries also all sank to the bottom for the most part. But no big deal &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be saving the recipe! Yummy!</p>

				<p>I made this tonight &#8211; it seriously took me that long to have a good excuse of hosting our best friends for supper.  At first I was a little bummed about the batter &#8211; it didn&#8217;t look as yummy as yours does in the picture, and as I was spreading the batter in the pan, I felt like my 1/2 c of blueberries in the batter didn&#8217;t go very far. </p>
<p>Then I licked the spatula. </p>
<p>Then I scraped the bowl out.  And licked the beater. </p>
<p>Then I scooped some batter back OUT of the pan and ate that too.  Then I finished the topping and popped it in the oven.</p>
<p>I had this baking while we were eating supper, and it smelled so yummy we were all distracted!  I had prepared a homemade vanilla ice cream custard and turned my ice cream maker on (the cuisinart electric one is the way to go) as soon as I took the Boy Bait out of the oven, so the ice cream had churned completely by the time the Boy Bait was done cooling. </p>
<p>Warm Blueberry Boy Bait with homemade vanilla ice cream&#8230;I seriously don&#8217;t have the words.  </p>
<p>I will definitely be making this again. </p>
<p>And my husband said his favorite thing about it was that it wasn&#8217;t so sweet that he couldn&#8217;t have a great big piece for breakfast in the morning!</p>

i made this yesterday &#8211; and while it tastes good<br />
when i turned it out of the pan &#8211; it completely fell apart..<br />
maybe still too warm after the 20 minutes?<br />

which i adore!</p>

				<p>Just put this n the oven. I was really looking forward to making this recipe all week&#8230;had all the ingredients and measured them out beforehand and read the recipe a few times before moving forward.<br />
However, I realized after the batter was in the pan that the brown sugar was not incorporated in the mix.<br />
I think I was a was a little thrown off by the instructions to blend in the &#8220;sugars.&#8221; This is the second recipe from your website that i have tried to make where the directions were either incorrect or vague (Raspberry cake&#8230; buttermilk recipe was incorrect and wasted 2 cups of milk).<br />
I LOVE your site and I must admit that I am a novice when it comes to baking. Is there something perhaps I&#8217;m doing wrong? Would love to hear your suggestions.</p>

				<p>Amanda &#8212; There are two sugars in the recipe, and you add them at the same time. Sorry to hear that you&#8217;re struggling with the recipes; I make them exactly as I tell others to and if my results and the other commenters are any indication, both this and the Raspberry cake recipes work as-is.

				<p>I made this last night&#8211;it&#8217;s too good!  I saw this in Cook&#8217;s Country also, but as one other comment said, it took seeing your photos to really spur me on.  I upped the blueberries quite a bit, probably 1 1/4 cups in the batter and 3/4 on top.  These people who had trouble with it sticking, I&#8217;m wondering whether they tossed the berries with the flour?  That&#8217;s what that small step is for.  Plus I did not do the flipping out and turning back over step, but perhaps the ones who had problems with that may want to try lining the pan with foil with extra length off the sides for handles, greasing the foil, and getting it out that way. And Amanda, above, yes the brown sugar does go in the batter; it&#8217;s the additional 1/4 cup of granulated that&#8217;s listing under &#8220;topping&#8221; that goes on top. Thanks Smitten :)</p>

				<p>So, I just showed this recipe to a friend who said it sounded &#8220;epically delicious&#8221; and I couldn&#8217;t agree more. It&#8217;s been stuck in my head pretty much since you posted it, and I scooped up some delish blueberries at my local farmer&#8217;s market this afternoon, ready to make boy bait happen at last. After a closer reading of the recipe, however, a mini tragedy struck. You see, I&#8217;m a broke college student whose kitchen (and 4 housemates) has been part of a lot of culinary ambitions (I made your pesto potato salad on Thursday-SO good!), but sadly enough, lacks an electric mixer. Do you think itd be at all possible to make this using a whisk and a good deal of upper arm strength or would it totally wreck it? Would love any input, and will be continue my quest for a borrowed mixer in the meantime. Thank you so much for your consistently drool-worthy recipes and photos!</p>

				<p>Blueberries were on sale this week, so luckily an excuse to make this recipe!</p>
<p>I was surprised at the consistency of the cake based on Deb&#8217;s photos. Mine turned out much higher, but what I was really surprised at is how dense and heavy this is, almost like a blueberry version of a coffee cake. I did toss the blueberries in the flour, but they still all ended up on the bottom (but didn&#8217;t stick). They actually &#8220;melted&#8221; and made this blueberry &#8220;jam&#8221; on the bottom, which was delicious, especially if you warm this up a bit before eating.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t imagine turning this out onto a platter without a disaster! The density and moistness of the cake most certainly would not allow it to be turned out without breaking apart.</p>
<p>The only disappointment was the sugar/cinnamon topping. It did not seem to do the cake justice. Not sure what to replace it with though. However, I still managed to eat a quarter of the cake by myself already!</p>

				<p>Oh Deb!  I made this cake at the weekend and give it 10/10!  It was wonderful.  I added the salt to the flour before realising that I only had salted butter in the house, but it worked wonderfully.</p>

				<p>You saved my dessert problem for last Friday night.  I went home Thursday and made this &#8211; I had everything on hand.  It was a great end to our meal and tasted great one day later (actually, it tasted great all weekend).</p>
<p>Looking forward to trying the Zucchini Pizza.  Thanks for staying on top of the farmers&#8217; market offerings.</p>

				<p>So I made this cake for a friend&#8217;s bday picnic and have to say its fantastic!</p>
<p>I have mild dyslexia so after reading the amount of salt 5x because I thought it was way too much, I proceeded to add 1 tablespoon of salt to my flour mixture.  Not until the cake was in the oven did I realize that it said TEASPOON of TABLE Salt.  crazy deb&#8230; BUT my friends thought that the saltiness complimented the sweetness great and loved it all the same.  I&#8217;d probably use a bit less next time, maybe 1.5 teaspoons, because I liked it a bit salty, but a whole tablespoon was a bit much!</p>
<p>Thanks again for another AWESOME recipe!</p>

				<p>CHRISSY &#8211; I too don&#8217;t have an electric mixer &#8211; I just left my butter out for a few hrs to soften up so that I could mix everything by hand.  I simply used a fork to mix the batter and it came out perfectly moist and delish (besides the saltiness&#8230; but hopefully you realize it says teaspoon, not tablespoon)</p>

				<p>Made this yesterday for the neighborhood picnic and it was the hit of the potluck.  It is fabulous, easy to throw together (I added more blueberries) and I did not bother turning it out of the pan.  When cooled, I cut it into squares and put it on the serving platter.  No problem with sticking at all&#8230;.used Bakers Joy spray.  Great stuff!  It will now become part of my baking &#8220;schtick&#8221; as my grown daughters say&#8230;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m sure this is a really annoying question, but is there any chance you could tell me where you go that greenish container that your blueberries are in? I&#8217;ve been looking for some for about a year now!  I think they would be really cute to save and plant herbs in. :)</p>

				<p>Amber &#8212; Not annoying. Greenmarkets and farmers markets tend to sell (and probably pick) produce in them. I agree they&#8217;re adorable. I found ceramic versions of them a couple years ago, which I mostly use for my own amusement, but they&#8217;ve since disappeared from the store where I bought them.</p>
<p>Britney &#8212; Definitely in the fridge for long periods. Can be out for a few hours, of course.</p>
<p>Jenny &#8212; Yes, but if you have 8-inch round pans with more than 2-inch sides, you&#8217;ll be best off. These used most of the 2-inch height of my 9-inch pans. (In an 8-inch square pan, you&#8217;ll have no problems.)</p>

				<p>Thanks Deb-not-the-author! :-) I&#8217;ve subbed for an electric mixer before, but there&#8217;s something about Smitten Kitchen recipes&#8211;maybe its the perfect pictures of the finished product?&#8211;that makes me want to be *extra* sure I&#8217;m doing everything right.</p>
<p>Oh, and worry not, your salt mixup is nothing compared to my own tsp/tbsp flub that went down a couple months ago when I made Deb&#8217;s &#8220;Baked brownie, spiced up.&#8221; Apparently my brain had been so thoroughly muddled by my finals week that I added 2 tbsps instead of teaspoons of CHIPOTLE POWDER (and to a double batch, no less.) There may or may not have been tears. (See also: finals week.) I ended up make a non-idiot batch they next day and they were, of course, amazing, and weeks later, after watching Chocolat and having very specific cravings for that spicy Mayan chocolate so worshiped in that movie, my friends and I heated up the overspiced brownies I&#8217;d frozen in hopes of turning them into mole sauce or *something*, and suddenly, they were the best mistakes I&#8217;d ever made.</p>

				<p>You published this just as I was trying to decide what desserts to bring to an outdoor party. Perfect! I doubled the berries also, and because my pan is very heavy, lined the bottom with buttered parchment, which definitely helped with removal. One thing I would say is to heed the &#8220;take out of the pan after 20 mins&#8221; instruction &#8211; the cake is so moist that, if it is allowed to cool all the way in the pan, it risks sogginess. (Not that the horde of locusts that descended and left me only with corner bits seemed to mind much.)</p>

				<p>This was so so yummy&#8211;but I had a couple mild technical difficulties. . .First, my batter was much more liquid-y than the one you picture being spread in the pan. . .I went back and reviewed, and I didn&#8217;t miss any steps or ingredients. . .the butter was soft, but not melted, and the blueberries were fresh. . .any ideas about what I might have done?</p>
<p>Also, my blueberries all sank to the bottom (even the ones that were put on top).  I suspect this might be related to the consistency of the batter, but I didn&#8217;t know if you might have another idea. . .</p>

				<p>Jendorf- I made this last night and I think I had mild difficulties as well.  The batter was not quite as thick as Deb&#8217;s picture either &#8211; what was your result?  Mine turned out tasty but were a bit fluffier and &#8220;cake-ier&#8221; than I was expecting &#8211; from Deb&#8217;s picture I was expecting a more dense bar-type treat.</p>

				<p>Sorry if the picture makes this unclear &#8212; the Boy Bait is a cake. Definitely on the heavy, buttery side for a cake (so it even feels a little weighty when you pick it up) but it is a cake in crumb/texture. So, it sounds like your results are spot-on. Not sure why the batter is thinner than mine, but if you&#8217;re getting a moist, tasty cake, it&#8217;s all the way it should be in the end.</p>

				<p>FANTASTIC cake &#8211; yes, it&#8217;s a bit weighty (which was a surprise when I went to remove from the baking pan) &#8211; but it&#8217;s not too sweat, very moist and the brown sugar makes a lovely change from your basic yellow sponge cake.</p>
<p>I made it for my MIL on Sunday &#8211; served it with a nice puddle of creme fresche that had been slightly sweetened with some powdered sugar &#8211; the slight sourness went really well with the cinnamon and sweet</p>

				<p>I made this last night and LOVED it. It was a cinch to make, didn&#8217;t call for a lot of fancy ingredients, and was delicious. I used buttermilk, my blueberries all sank, and it wouldn&#8217;t flip out of the pan, but I took it to work and the leftovers to a meeting afterward and there is about one bite left for me to eat tomorrow. Did not advertise the name at work for fear of getting called out for sexual harassment ;-)</p>

				<p>I just made this last night and it was wonderful! We used fresh berries, tossed in the flour as per your suggestion and they were wonderfully sweet and tart in the middle of each piece. We did have light brown sugar and used demerara but it was still wonderful! I didn&#8217;t have the right size pan so I improvised and made it in a circular spring-form pan and then cut wedges like a cake. Divine! Thank you for passing on yet another stand-out recipe!</p>

Second, I love this recipe.  Can&#8217;t wait to make it.  This weekend for sure.  And finally, I am so freaking jealous -237 comments on one post.  Any suggestions for getting so many people excited enough to comment are always appreciated.  I will be back again soon.  First I have to go thank UltraRunnerGirl for telling me about you.</p>

				<p>Have you heard of a thing called English Monkey? If you&#8217;re after crazy names, this fits the bill. It&#8217;s a type of Walsh Rarebit (grilled cheese on toast?). Check it out: <a href="http://www.recoveredrecipes.com/search?q=english+monkey" rel="nofollow">http://www.recoveredrecipes.com/search?q=english+monkey</a></p>
<p>By the way, LOVE the recipe! It&#8217;s winter here in NZ so can I substitute fresh for frozen blueberries or is it best to wait until they are in season?</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I had a baking urge last night and had bookmarked this when you originally posted it.  So I put the batter together while I was cooking our dinner, and then baked it while we ate.  It smelled like heaven the whole time it was baking and it tastes ever better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so good in fact that I brought the majority of it to work today for my coworkers to snack on &#8212; lest I keep it all at home and eat the whole cake myself!</p>

				<p>I recently went blueberry picking in Upstate New York and I have had this recipe bookmarked since I came back with pounds of blueberries.  I finally made it last night and it was amazing!

				<p>I made this two days ago, and while it does make a delicious and perfectly moist blueberry cake, you&#8217;re also right- it&#8217;s *almost* too buttery. Next time I&#8217;m going to double the amount of blueberries. I keep dreaming of adding some kind of light frosting or glaze to it, but wonder if that might complicate things, because really, it&#8217;s quite perfect.</p>

Cut the topping a bit, doubled the berries, skim milk ( either that or Lactaid&#8230;ick!, 40 minutes in a glass pan, and cake nirvana ensued.  So moist.  So delicious.

				<p>I am new to the site and was very intriqued by the Blueberry Boy Bait cake.  I love blueberry anything.  My son and I made this together yesterday and absolutely loved it.  I knew right away it was going to be good, as it was the best batter I had ever tasted.  I did not have whole milk on hand so I used 1 cup of 2% milk with an additional 2T of butter.  It was amazing.  One note I have is the recipe says to bake it for 45 minutes to an hour &#8211; my toothpicks came out clean at 33 minutes.  I was so glad I check it when I did.   It came out perfect, nicely golden and extremely moist.   So I baited one boy (age 5), now we will see what his father says.   We also made the watermelon lemonade, which was also very tasty. Thanks for putting out such a beautiful site with great recipes</p>

				<p>I made this in two 9&#8243; round pans today, and one is already gone.  And now it&#8217;s almost midnight, and I&#8217;m standing in my kitchen eating more.  This was so simple, but so addictive.  I used a bit less sugar, and I added three apricots as well and perhaps an extra 1/3 cup blueberries.  I also used 1/2 cup milk + 1/2 cup sour cream in place of the 1 cup whole milk, and it worked just fine.  I feel like all the extra fruit made the &#8220;bait&#8221; even more moist if such a thing is possible with a recipe that uses two sticks of butter.</p>

				<p>Deb &#8211; I just have to tell you that I just received an e-mail from my sister with the subject line &#8220;S.K. S.A.&#8221;.  I was like, what the heck is SKSA?  </p>
<p>Well&#8230;my sister just made this recipe and said people were coming back for 5th helpings!  Whenever my sisters, mom, and I make one of your recipes and love it (which is always), we send each other an e-mail entitled &#8220;Smitten Kitchen Strikes Again&#8221;.  So, you&#8217;ve now been reduced to SKSA, but hold a huge spot in our hearts!</p>
<p>Thank you for being you &#8211; funny, witty, and a damn good cook &#8211; and making me a better cook day by day.  Can you say &#8220;cutest 6-in layer pink lady birthday cake&#8221;?  By far, the most beautiful cake I&#8217;ve ever made &#8211; thanks to your advice!</p>
<p>- Mary from Astoria</p>

				<p>Hi!  I love your site. Saw the Blueberry Boy Bait recipe and knew I had to make it. Thought I had all the ingredients on hand. Only to find I only had two eggs.  Made it anyway.  And it tasted fantastic! Everyone loved it. </p>
<p>I froze half. We just pulled it out of the freezer this morning. Tastes delish. </p>
<p>Thanks for all the great recipes, commentary and photos.  Love it!</p>

				<p>My 10 year old son was skeptical of this one since he doesn&#8217;t like blueberries.  After trying a piece he said, &#8220;I guess I know why they call this blueberry boy bait.  Can I have another piece?&#8221;  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 8 x 8 square pan &#8211; came out just lovely.  Great recipe &#8211; thanks!</p>

				<p>I made the boy bait and it is fablous!! It was so moist I couldn&#8217;t believe it.<br />
I did add an extra handful of berries to my taste.<br />
I brought it to work and it was devoured in no time! You will have more subscribers to this site by lunchtime!<br />

				<p>I have to tell you that I made this:<br />
First, with blueberries &#8211; YUM.<br />
Second, with raspberries &#8211; OH MY GOODNESS, it was absolutely delish.  I made homemade ice cream and we had warm cake with extra raspberries drizzled over the top.  Simply Magnificent!<br />
I honestly think I would be happy with just the cake alone.  I love the flavor and the texture.<br />
I love you Smitten Kitchen!  :-)</p>

				<p>I tried this tonight and it is glorious!!  I visited my grandparents over the weekend, who have a patch of several Tiff Blue blueberry bushes. This is the first week any berries had ripened and I came home with about 6 pints.  Most are in the freezer now and I look forward to making this many times over, even when they go out of season.  The batter turned out just as they look in Deb&#8217;s pictures for me, it had good body, a nice, spreadable consistency and wasn&#8217;t runny or thin as cake batter.  Thanks for the great recipe, I can&#8217;t wait to share it with my mom!</p>

				<p>A lot of yum! Easy to make. I did with buttermilk and it turned out delish. :-) Only made half of the recipe&#8230;it lasted 24 hours. Needless to say, for boys and girls, alike! A great way to get rid of buttermilk/whole milk, and a great way to use up fruit in season! Lots of fun to make and eat, as well as super easy! You can&#8217;t mess it up even if you try! Definitely going on my recipe of the year list! :-) (as soon as I make one!) Thanks!!</p>

				<p>After reading through the comments of your baked berry desserts, I was thinking about why some berries sink and other don&#8217;t and while some stay firm and others turn to mush. I think it may have to do with the differences in the berries themselves. Depending on the variety, time of year, and the freshness, blueberries (or any fruit) can be small, big, soft, hard, etc. Some varieties may have more liquid in them and others may be drier. I&#8217;d love to do an experiment, but it would be tricky trying to get different varieties of the same fruit.</p>

				<p>I made this twice this week.  The first time the dog liked it very much.  I left it to cool only to find it completely gone when I came back in the house.  So I made it the next night for a dinner with friends and everybody loved it.  I have learned a new baking secret.  Instead of flour I prepare the pan with sugar.  It makes for a nice crunchy outside.  It is lovely.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.</p>

				<p>I offered this beautiful cake to my husband who politely declined. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t like blueberries in cake,&#8221; he said.  I then told him the name of the cake. He was intrigued enough to try a piece and happily retracted his earlier comment. Bait success!</p>
<p>Based on earlier comments, I upped the sugar about 1/4 cup and added some more blueberries. I also tried a different technique to see if I could keep the fruit from sinking to the bottom. It worked for me so maybe someone else will try it. Before folding in the blueberries, I spooned about 1/4 to 1/3 of the batter in the baking dish and spread it evenly. Then I folded in the floured berries and added the rest of the batter to the baking pan. None of the berries sank to the bottom.</p>

				<p>A thousand thanks for the recipe, which happened  to be the best in-law&#8217;s bait ever ! I&#8217;ve done it today and despite the canned blueberries  I did not changed a comma (as we say in french) to your recipe. I wasn&#8217;t sure about the result because of the surplus of sugar brought by the canned fruits&#8230; but it turned out just fine. I can&#8217;t wait to test it with raspeberries&#8230; they are my favourites !</p>

				<p>I made this on a Friday night and 5 days later I see my husbandbought some fresh blue berries &#8211; I ask what they are for and I get this response: &#8220;for you to make that blueberry cake again.&#8221; Kids eyes lit up and they exclaimed, &#8220;you&#8217;re making the blueberry cornbread again?! YESSSSS!&#8221; (I guess blueberry boy bait is a bit hard to remember. Everyone relates it to something familiar)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say both times the entire pan was devoured in about 45 minutes. Go big or go home, I suppose. Thanks for such a success and new family favorite!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this four times in the last week for a pig roast, potluck, goodbye party, and just for friends.  By the fourth time I was adding more blueberries because you can never have enough. It got thumbs up at every party and several people asked for the recipe-as always I direct them to Smitten Kitchen.</p>

				<p>I just finished making this and my batter came out a lot more mousse-like than yours did. It is currently cooling, but I&#8217;m worried that humidity may have made things a little bit different. I&#8217;ve been baking for probably fifteen years and never seen the consistency I ended up with (I always have a thick batter when working with the flour:butter:sugar ratio this recipe had). Hm.</p>

				<p>Okay, so an update from my last comment:</p>
<p>Just let the cake cool and went to do the grand unveiling; as soon as I flipped it onto a platter, the entire bottom layer came off even though it wasn&#8217;t stuck to the pan. As I cut it into pieces, it completely fell apart, but it tastes fine. It didn&#8217;t look as dense as yours&#8230;it crumbled really but it tasted moist and cake-like. I&#8217;m stumped! Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started reading your website recently, and this was the first thing I&#8217;ve made.  I substituted fresh strawberries, and everyone whose tried it has GONE CRAZY for it, thank you!

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this recipe many times (since finding it in Cooks Country) using different fruits, and while it is great with lots of different fruits, my absolute favorite fruit to make this recipe with is black raspberries.  I also use a full cup of fruit in the batter, and a half cup in the topping, because the fruit is what it&#8217;s all about!</p>

				<p>Add me to the list of those whose batter came out a little more liquidy than Deb&#8217;s&#8230; I am guessing hers was that thick because of the buttermilk. My blueberries (the cake ones and the topping ones) also all sank straight to the bottom (even though I tossed the cake ones in flour first). </p>
<p>This was totally delicious regardless of where the blueberries ended up. But I think I *might* have liked the uncooked batter a little more than the finished cake! I could NOT stop licking the spoon, bowl, beaters&#8230; dangerous. :P</p>

				<p>I was asked if this recipe could be prepared the night before &#8211; up to spreading the batter in the pan- and then topped and baked in the morning.  The question took me by surprise as I&#8217;d never considered doing something like that.  I&#8217;ve measured and prepped ingredients in advance (night before) and mixed it all in the morning to bake, though.</p>

				<p>Blueberry boy bait was one of the first things my grandmother taught me to make and then I went and &#8220;caught&#8221; a man who hates blueberries. BUT, I went blueberry picking this morning and have 4 lbs of blueberries to do something with, so I&#8217;m definitely making this sometime this week.</p>

				<p>Loved this! Made it recently with the following changes: 1.5 sticks butter, reduced sugars to 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar (used recipe amount for the topping), increased blueberries by 1/4 cup each in batter and in topping, and used low-fat milk plus some vinegar for a &#8220;homemade&#8221; buttermilk. Turned out great, even with these modifications. Still plenty sweet. Tender, loose crumb, but still held up as a bar cake. Like some other commenters, although I tossed my blueberries with flour, they still sank. Maybe my (fresh) blueberries were too big? Anyway, it didn&#8217;t bother me at all. If it bothers others, perhaps they should try using those small wild blueberries.</p>
<p>Deb &#8212; I am just thrilled for you and Alex! Funny how I can be so excited for someone I don&#8217;t know, but I am. First pregnancy, first baby &#8212; nothing like it. Enjoy this time!</p>

				<p>Great recipe — I&#8217;m adding it to my regular rotation. I made a few amendments:<br />
• Subbed in Ontario peaches, since they are in season, and used about 1.5 cups total. Could&#8217;ve even used 2 cups and I would have wanted more.<br />
• Sprinkled demerara sugar and cinnamon on top for crunch<br />
• Also used buttermilk. So fluffy!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, I really love your website, I do, I do, I do. But recently all the recipes I tried have been a major letdown and I keep scratching my head. This cake is far too sweet and after eating the second piece my disappointment was undeniable. I offered the rest of the cake at my office, where they usually love your creations, but the feedback was the same, too sweet and a bit bland. Was it my fault?</p>

				<p>Oh, Deb, I made this recipe yesterday because my husband and I have an excess of seasonal blueberries (in Quebec, where we can pick them, but that activity is not as fun as it would sound) and I wanted to do something with them before they went bad or if we couldn&#8217;t eat them fast enough. Of course, you&#8217;re my go-to website for baking (I am a novice baker) and remembered this. </p>
<p>I cannot believe what a perfect cake this is. It hit all the right notes: rich, not too rich, tart, fruity, hints of cinnamon and buttermilk. My husband can&#8217;t stop tearing through it&#8212;I have been a little more restrained. I am posting my experience with it on my blog tomorrow (full credit to you, of course) if you&#8217;d like to check it out.</p>
<p>If not, thanks for such a great recipe anyway!</p>

				<p>Just made this and it looks great until&#8230;i turned it over to get it out of the pan after 20mins.  some of it was still stuck in the pan and I greased well.  Don&#8217;t know what happened&#8230;so i tasted it.  Still has great flavor and is yummy!  Hope the people at work don&#8217;t judge the appearance.  :-(  I put it back into the pan to hide the look and its ok&#8230;still a little weird in one corner. Doesn&#8217;t look like the finished product in the picture.  What a bummer!</p>

				<p>Finally got around to making this cake today.  I could have eaten the raw batter with a spoon!  It was so fluffy.  It smelled wonderful while it was baking.  Turned out great except that the blueberries still sunk to the bottom, even tho I floured them.  Also, is the recipe correct when it calls for a teaspoon of salt?  That&#8217;s a lot!  I think I could detect it in the cake.  Anyway when I take it to work tomorrow I know it will be gobbled up fast!</p>

				<p>I made this today for my husband and boy is it good! Came out very light for me, yours does look much more dense than mine&#8230; and like many others, all my fresh blueberries (even though they were coated in flour) sank to the bottom of the pan. The taste is still amazing!</p>

				<p>I wonder if this would freeze okay? Freeze the batter, or after baked?<br />
I have a lot of blueberries on hand and want to bake with them, but I don&#8217;t want to be eating a whole cake myself, haha.<br />
If I could freeze half, I would probably make this..hmmm.</p>

				<p>Most amazing snack cake on the planet!  I was passing through the Amish lands of Pennsylvania and found a farmstand that was selling pints of fresh, organic, Amish-farmed blueberries.  It was heaven to make this cake with those berries.  To die for!  I used whole milk Greek-style yogurt and it was so tender and moist. Melted in your mouth delicious.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>arrgh, i had my heart set on making this, but just realized i only have a stick and a half of butter in my fridge. :(  do you think it would come out alright if i used shortening to make up the difference, or should i go back out into the 90 degree heat to buy a stick of butter?</p>

				<p>I made this last night and it turned out well, but kind of an odd texture: moist and crumbly at the same time. The batter looked curdled after I was done mixing in the flour and milk. I used cold milk because I forgot to set some out to come to room temp. like the butter and eggs. Could that be the reason?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this three times this summer&#8211; it&#8217;s so good! I used more blueberries than called for, both in the batter and the topping.  Once I added some grated orange zest (I had half an orange left over from another recipe).  This always gets raves&#8211; as does the raspberry buttermilk cake.</p>

				<p>I made this two days ago to take to work to share. It was fantastic. Absolutely perfect. The flavor of the dough is so buttery and kind of sweet, but it complemented the blueberries well. And the texture was interesting too. Crumbly, but very moist and almost doughy even though it was &#8220;done&#8221;. Thanks for the recipe, Deb!</p>

				<p>Thank you for the recipe.</p>
<p>Here goes my changes: I swapped half of the flour with whole wheat flour. I decreased both sugars to 1/4 cup each and decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. In place of milk, I used 1/2 cup of non-fat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 cup of skim (non-fat) milk. </p>
<p>As for the blueberries, I increased it to a total of 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries, and also included 1/2 cup mixture of chopped peaches and sliced bananas. (One large ripe peach and one small ripe banana.) I mixed all the fruit together with 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, increased the flour to 2 1/2 tablespoons, and excluded the extra sugar. Finally, I folded the entire fruit mixture into the batter. Then, instead of placing it into a regular baking pan, I poured the now-finished batter into greased and floured muffin tins. They were done in 24 minutes.</p>
<p>It turned out better than I thought it would. Some of fruit did sink, but most of it did manage to stay on top of the muffins. Slightly crispy on top (as muffin tops are) with some cracks on top. (From the heat escaping.) Wonderful buttery taste. Really does not need any more salt. I would probably add another banana in next time, too. The banana flavor is very subtle (a little too subtle for me). Peaches were slightly moist without being wet. I must say these are the best muffins I&#8217;ve ever tasted. </p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

				<p>It smells so good baking. I am giving the recipe a chance to snare me as is, but I desperately wanted to add lemon rind and vanilla  (as some other posters have suggested). If this replaces my current blueberry muffin recipe, I will be throwing the batter in muffin tins. Also, if this gets my a diamond ring, I will make it my life&#8217;s mission to pass your blog on to every single woman I meet. haha!</p>

				<p>I made a lighter version with just one stick of butter, replaced two of the eggs with 4 egg whites and used 2% instead of whole milk. The cake was still tender, delicious and sweet. My family loved it- I&#8217;ll definitely make it again.</p>

				<p>I had a pint of blueberries I wanted to use and this was the perfect dessert for them!  When I made this, I thought the directions said to use a 9 inch pan (I totally misread the 13 x 9 part) so I used a 9 x 9.  Twenty minutes into cooking I realized the mistake and noticed it had risen just above the top of the pan.  After 40 minutes of baking, it was still a little jiggly in the middle.  After cooking for a total of ~55 minutes the toothpick came out clean.  They were actually perfect with a very moist bottom and center and a crispy top just like in your photos!  Thanks for this LOVELY recipe.  I can&#8217;t wait to make them again!</p>

I can&#8217;t wait to eat some! Thanks for posting this, I had some leftover frozen blueberries that needed to be used and this was the perfect way to get them out of the freezer.</p>
<p>Off to see if I can cut a piece out of the pan&#8230;<br />

				<p>Hi!  </p>
<p>I tried making this today, but I didn&#8217;t have a mixer, so I had to do everything by hand&#8230;My batter was much more liquid than that shown in your pictures.  More similar to pancake batter than the light, doughy look that yours has.  All of my blueberries sank to the bottom during the baking process :(</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not a baker, so I was hoping this recipe might boost my confidence a bit, but it didn&#8217;t&#8230;Do you think the fact that I didn&#8217;t have a mixer made a difference with the consistency of my batter?  I assume that the consistency of it was the reason that the berries sank to the bottom, rather than being suspended in it.</p>
<p>If anyone could answer that for me, I&#8217;d be very grateful!  :)  Thank you so much!  And I love, love, love the Smitten Kitchen blog!</p>
<p>-Jess</p>

				<p>I made this tonight with my 3 year old daughter. I let her stir and help put ingredients into the bowl. When I was getting ready to do the last part she stuck her finger into the batter, tasted it, and announced, &#8220;This is really good, Mommy!&#8221; She was even giving me a thumbs up! We loved it and are planning to share it with our &#8220;boys&#8221; (daddy and brother) for breakfast in the morning :)</p>

				<p>I am sure this is extremely belated but as I made this cake all summer and plan to do it again this summer, is there any harm in baking a couple and freezing them well-wrapped?</p>

				<p>I have been waiting months to make this, and since we finally got blueberries from our csa it is now in the oven, and judging by how good the house smells (and how good the batter tasted&#8230;shh, don&#8217;t tell) I cannot wait to eat this!<br />
Thanks for yet another wonderful recipe!</p>

				<p>I made this last week. After the cake cooled on my way out, I decided to slice 2 squares for my doorman and 1 for me as I do my errands.  I got into the elevator with my neighbor and gave her the square for me since she said she loved blueberries&#8230;Both loved these as did I.  It was tasty and easy.</p>

				<p>I just made a batch of these and felt compelled to comment as they cool (not that I&#8217;ve, um, already eaten a piece). First of all, wow! So yummy and moist and buttery and light and the little speckles of blueberry are just gorgeous. I left out the cinnamon and they were perfect, they seemed to get more of a crust on top than the one in the pictures did but hey, more crumbs for me! I didn&#8217;t have the right size pan so I split it up into two batches, one in a 8&#215;8&#8243; baking tray and one in a shallow roasting dish. It worked perfectly, but even better was that I added a hunk of finely chopped white chocolate to the second batch. If you are even vaguely contemplating doing this, then DO IT. It is so good, especially melty and straight from the oven. My only concern is getting it out of the pan in its little squares and not a heap of (still delicious) crumbs, and getting it to last til Sunday afternoon.<br />
Oh, and it really does serve 12 generously: they&#8217;re big slices. You could definitely stretch it further, especially with some ice-cream on the side.<br />
Thanks Deb! I can&#8217;t thank you enough for your lovely site.</p>

				<p>I made this for the first time today.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t overly impressed with it to be honest.  I found it far too sweet, and other than the overwhelming sugary taste it was pretty bland.<br />
I&#8217;m thinking some lemon zest, or lemon juice might add something nice to the flavour.<br />
I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ll ever make this again though, even to experiment with it.<br />
Hopefully the boys in the house will like it enough to eat the whole cake.</p>

				<p>Christina &#8212; Definitely chilling them helps. I will even stick things in the freezer for 10 minutes, just to get clean cuts. But, I do think for this cake I just used a good bread knife&#8230;</p>

				<p>I made this because I might be in love with blueberry recipes but when I turned it out, about 1/3 stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I greased with a PAM cooking spray and definitely sprinkled with flour and even let it cool for a bit&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what I did wrong&#8230; Anyway, the cake was amazing!  My boyfriend and his roommates at the whole thing in like 3 days!</p>

				<p>I made this on the weekend for a street party. My blueberries also sank. And I thought it would be too hard to invert it out of the pan and then flip it over. I&#8221;m just not that co-ordinated so I cut it out like brownies. It was devoured quickly!</p>

				<p>I just pulled this out of the oven.  it only took 34-35 minutes to bake (my oven runs hot).  I think I could have even taken it out a minute or two earlier(mine is a little more brown on top than the one you pictured).  I guess we&#8217;ll see how it turned out once it is cut.

				<p>Made this last night to take to dinner with family. My aunt is a big blueberry buckle fan, so I thought this would be a different take on essentially blueberry coffee cake. It was excellent! I love blueberries and doubled the amount in the cake and also through a ton more on top. We were running late so we only baked in 30 minutes at home and then 20 during dinner, so it was warm for serving. We didn&#8217;t have any problems with the blueberries sinking, and my husband thoroughly greased and floured the pan, and it came right out perfectly (we did brownie style too and didn&#8217;t flip it). Less then 18 hours later and its almost all gone. Thanks for the delicious recipe with the amusing title!</p>

				<p>I just made this and turned it into a blueberry upside down cake. I spread 4 tbsp melted butter around the bottom, sprinkled 4 tbsp brown sugar over this followed by 1 1/2 c. of blueberries before throwing the batter down on top of this. I then skipped the blueberry sugar topping, as my topping was on the bottom of the pan. It is delicious!</p>

<p>For anyone who found this cake a bit bland, try adding a tablespoon of fresh-grated ginger and half a teaspoon of minced lemon zest to the batter after the eggs.  They&#8217;ll give the cake a bright, summery kick.</p>

				<p>This was awesome!  So light and delicate with a butter overload, it was a big hit with my family!  Like many others, my blueberries sunk.  They were pretty big blueberries though so thats most likely the reason.  We brought a plate over to some friends and they have been raving for days!  Thanks for the great recipe, we definitely make again :)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve had this recipe bookmarked for a long time now, and finally got around to making it.  This is absolutely one sugary, buttery delicious cake.  I was expecting more coffee-cake-like texture, but texture-wise I think this is like no other cake I&#8217;ve had.  So tender and soft.  The only change I made was to throw in some extra blueberries and top with sliced almonds.  This cake is so good in fact, that I&#8217;m going to have to avoid making it again or only make it for special occassions where it will be shared, so that I don&#8217;t end up eating way more than I should!</p>

				<p>I made this last year, and took it out of the oven when the toothpick came out clean (at 30-35 min), but the texture was beyond moist, to fudgy.  Is is safe to assume that this cake is much too buttery to really worry about drying out by overbaking?  That is, should I just bake it for the recommended time?  Also, do you think I should up the sugar if trying it with sour cherries?</p>

				<p>This turned out SO warm, and light and comforting! I made a drizzle to put over the top to liven it up a bit more using<br />
- powdered sugar<br />
- fresh squeezed lemon juice<br />
- half &#8216;n half<br />
- nutmeg<br />
- freshly grated lemon zest<br />
This gives it a nice pop and is SO delicious!</p>

From one cake lover to another&#8230; have you tried a Lumberjack Cake? It&#8217;s an absolute hit&#8230; date &amp; apple with a crunchy coconut topping&#8230; it&#8217;s a winner in the cake department, a real crowd pleaser. Can also be served warmed as a pudding with caramel sauce. <a href="http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Lumberjack-Cake-L425.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Lumberjack-Cake-L425.html</a><br />

				<p>I was so happy to see this recipe! It&#8217;s a close cousin of my mom&#8217;s famous Blueberry Thing (&#8220;Thing&#8221; because it&#8217;s not quite a cake, not quite a bread&#8230;). Blueberry Thing (provenance unknown) uses sour cream and is dusted only with sugar. The best part is always the gooey center that never quite bakes all the way through. Now I&#8217;m tempted to have a blueberry bake-off to compare the two!</p>

				<p>I have to admit, I had to take a deep breath before unwrapping two sticks of butter and throwing them in a bowl.  I&#8217;m so glad I did!  This turned out moist and buttery and delicious.  My berries sank too, but I&#8217;ll forgive them.  I wish I had put a little bit more cinnamon sugar on top &#8211; or I wonder if maybe some turbinado sugar on top of this at the end might give it a nice little crunch?  That&#8217;s what I do on my banana bread &#8211; but this is so much lighter, maybe that would be too much hefty sweetness on top?  Anyway, this was great for dessert on Saturday night and great for breakfast on Sunday morning.</p>

				<p>Just to say, I baked this twice this week alone and it keeps disappearing!! &gt;:[___]<br />
(I swapped 1/2 flour for 1/4 whole wheat and 1/4 hazelnut flour and the 1/2 cup sugar for 1 ts of stevia) I will try next with black currants ! (I suspect it will still disappear, though :p)</p>

				<p>I am new to baking and am learning on my own from trial and error as I go. I really want to try out this recipe but the only home oven I have access to only crank up to 250 degrees celsius at full power. I noticed that the recipe calls for &#8220;350 degrees&#8221;, I was wondering if it&#8217;s still okay to bake a cake at a lower heat please? Or are there ways of getting around it (i.e. I&#8217;ve heard using a dark coloured cake pan). </p>
<p>Thank you very much for sharing the recipe and any advice in advance, the cake looks fantastic (as with every other dish on smittenkitchen). I do apologise if I may have misinterpreted any info or instructions on the recipe.</p>

				<p>rachel &#8212; The 350 is Fahrenheit, which would be 180 Celsius. I have more temperature/oven conversions listed <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/cooking-conversions/#Temperature" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

				<p>I made this for the first time two weeks ago after seeing the link on Lauren Conrad&#8217;s website and my family is obsessed with this recipe! I did add an entire cup of blueberries to the actual cake batter as well as a little more than half of a cup on the topping just to make it extra fruity and it is absolutely delicious! Great recipe!</p>

				<p>I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8X8 pan.  It was delicious, so moist, so sweet, so buttery.  It didn&#8217;t last a whole day, every time I walked by I couldn&#8217;t resist snatching another piece.  The blueberries all sank straight to the bottom, which was a little disappointing, but didn&#8217;t stop us from eating and enjoying every last crumb.</p>

				<p>Ah, you never disappoint!<br />
I made this last night (after some orange sesame chicken) in an attempt to rescue a life-marathon of one disappointing event after another.<br />
I didn&#8217;t even flour the blueberries and they seemed to be just fine. Okay, maybe they sunk to the bottom, but some of the topping blueberries had started the southern migration as well, so&#8230;.happy medium.<br />
My bf and I LOVE this cake and with blueberries so much cheaper in the summer, we can afford to! Hurray!</p>

				<p>When Harris Teeter advertised a &#8216;buy 1 punnet of blueberries, get 2 free&#8217; &#8211; I thought it would be rude not to take them up on the offer&#8230; So after buying them and searching smitten kitchen for a blueberry dish I could make with the ingredients I had at home, I found this one..</p>
<p>I have one thing to say&#8230;  SENSATIONAL!</p>
<p>This cake is bloody delicious, not to mention so simple and idiot proof!  I don&#8217;t even have an electric mixer and it turned out as light and fluffy as ever (perhaps I just have a strong arm?) </p>
<p>Anywho, anyone thinking of making this should def give it a go!</p>

				<p>Everyone (boys and girls) loved the &#8220;Blueberry Boy Bait&#8221; that I baked. However, I did have some edits. I used brown sugar instead of light brown sugar that the recipe calls for. I also put in some extra blueberries. And I only baked it for 30-35 minutes.<br />
I think I will be making a drizzle next time to top the dessert with (probably the one suggested by Amanda #356, sounds yummy) since it turned out a little dry.</p>

				<p>Made Them last week and made the biggest mistake ever! In stead of 1 teaspoon salt, I don&#8217;t know how but I put in 1 Tablespoon Salt.  I didn&#8217;t figure this out until my Mom Tasted the.. Me just started backing so! And have to get used to the USA measurements.<br />
!!!However!!! All my friends and family did like them. It gave them a different kind of twist!They were all finished. Next time I&#8217;ll look better at the measurements :P</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m know I&#8217;m late to this party &#8211; but I have to tell you, I love this recipe.  I followed a comment on epicurious bragging that your blackberry cake was tastier than their blackberry cake. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to test that claim, yet.  Blueberry Boy Bait is going to become a staple; it is so darn good.  You have a wonderful blog, thanks very much!</p>

				<p>To keep the berries from all sinking (and I use one cup in the batter and one cup on top), here&#8217;s my tip. Spread up to 1/2 the batter into the pan before folding in the berries. Use enough so you can spread the batter without it pulling up and away from the floured surface. Then, fold the berries into the remaining batter and add to the pan.<br />
I always add more sugar, and it takes much less time to bake in my oven. I starting checking after 25-30 minutes.</p>

				<p>Ok, so I just made it for a second time, this time for a friend who came back in Paris. Well, I&#8217;ll admit it, also to celebrate a last summer baking, Paris getting quite automn-y lately&#8230; My oven being quite small (I mean like really small), I made it both times in a 23&#215;23 cm pan, 2/3ing the recipe. Yeap, I love my math too! It was amazing, again, and I think in my head it will always be this summers&#8217; cake :) And, as I&#8217;ve mentionned before, in my totally misplaced ps in my dobos torte comment, as for the boy, it worked like a charm ;)</p>

				<p>I made this yesterday. The texture was fluffy and moist, the topping was nice, and I didn&#8217;t have any problems with the blueberries sinking. However, the cake itself was very, very bland and flavorless. I think it needs *something*&#8211;vanilla, lemon zest, or maybe even an extra pinch of salt. I will make it again, but I&#8217;ll definitely modify it a bit next time. Also, it only took 30 minutes to bake, so if you wait 45 minutes to check it, you might find yourself with a very dry cake.</p>

				<p>I had some frozen blueberries to use and I weighed between blueberry crumb bars (which I had made on a number of occasions, every time perfect) and this recipe and ended up making the boy bait. I wish I didn&#8217;t because I didn&#8217;t like it. I mean, I did eat it (I hate throwing food away) with a glass of milk but I didn&#8217;t enjoy it. It was like any plain yellow cake and I don&#8217;t like yellow cakes. Not worth of the blueberries and the butter. :)</p>

				<p>Deb, every blessed time I read this recipe title, my brain interprets it not as, &#8220;blueberry-flavored bait for a boy&#8221; but instead as &#8220;bait for a blueberry boy.&#8221; I&#8217;m not exactly sure what a blueberry boy is, but I&#8217;m sure I would love to catch one. (For the record, I vaguely imagine a curly-headed child with blue suspenders who sneaks around snatching handfuls of poorly-guarded blueberry desserts.)</p>
