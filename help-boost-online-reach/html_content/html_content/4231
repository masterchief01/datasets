<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-469" href="http://life.seven-seas.com/good-sleep-hygiene/gettyimages_98401700-cropped-2"><img class="size-full wp-image-469 alignleft" title="GettyImages_98401700-cropped" src="http://212.78.91.57/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/GettyImages_98401700-cropped1.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="323" /></a><strong>‘I can’t get no sleep’, howled Faithless in their 2007 Insomnia album. It really is how many, many people feel &#8211; in fact 37% of us are estimated to suffer from insomnia<sup>1</sup>. There are so many causes of this, many of which are outside the scope of this advice. Many situations, for example poor relationships or financial problems, underlying health problems e.g. pain, discomfort, a weak bladder may disrupt your sleep. Several medications and dietary choices can contribute to sleeping badly.</strong></p>
<p>It is always a good idea to apply good ‘sleep hygiene’ to make sure that the way that you are behaving is not contributing to your sleeplessness. You need to be sure that you are not the cause of your own lack of energy, daytime drowsiness and overall exhaustion.  It really is important to take how we sleep seriously; sleep allows body and mind time to restore and repair, to process the physical and mental strains of our modern life. If we do not value and nurture it, we do so at our peril.</p>
<h4>The mechanics of sleep</h4>
<p>We sleep in a rhythm, a ‘sleep cycle’ that needs to be maintained to make sure that we produce the correct balance of our sleep promoting chemicals at the right times. These chemicals are produced by our body, using the building blocks that we absorb from our food and drink.  They are also dependent on the timing and quantity of light and darkness to which we are exposed.  Melatonin and serotonin control when and how much we sleep. They are responsible for our ‘sleep quality’ and ultimately how rested we feel – assuming we are fit and healthy and do not have any external factors e.g. medication or stimulants that are disrupting this</p>
<p>We often think that it is just our brain that is dictating our sleep patterns, but since our digestive system actually contains more of both of these chemicals than our brains do, it may have an important role to play in how we feel and sleep. This makes sense to many of us – how often do you suffer digestive disruption before a stressful situation? One of the first things to do if you are having trouble sleeping is to address any potential digestive problems – <a title="The Gut, The Bad and the Ugly." href="http://life.seven-seas.com/the-right-foods-for-healthy-gut-bacteria-and-flora">The Gut, The Bad and the Ugly</a></p>
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></h4>
<h4>Some top tips for where you sleep</h4>
<p>Make your bedroom a sanctuary and as far as possible keep it dark and quiet. If you are constantly disturbed by noise, take steps to change this. Good ideas include: ear plugs, double glazing, finding an alternative bedroom, establishing new household rules, speaking to your neighbours. Add black out blinds to your window dressings, these can be fitted behind existing curtains.</p>
<p>Keep your bedroom as a place of rest, so working and TV watching should be done elsewhere.  Keep your bedroom for easy reading, sleeping and having sex.</p>
<h4>Getting ready for bed</h4>
<p>Maximise your chances of a good night’s sleep, get into the best ‘going to bed’ habits</p>
<p>Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even in the holidays or on days off work. Our body works in cycles and so establish a good routine for sleep.</p>
<p>Dim the lights all the way around the house one or two hours before you go to bed. The body increases levels of sleep inducing melatonin at ‘nightfall’. In our modern world of electric lights this natural indicator of bedtime for the body can completely pass us by.</p>
<p>Take a relaxing bath before bed time; a few drops of lavender essential oil mixed into the bath can help you to feel calm.</p>
<p>If you are worrying about your daytime life, consider relaxation techniques. Consider a ‘take the day away’ routine, ideas include :- a relaxing bath in low lighting,  meditation or some deep breathing or listening to calm music before you go to your bedroom.</p>
<p>Aim to turn off the TV at least half an hour before bedtime; we can be over stimulated by all the noise and light. A TV in the bedroom is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Try a calming, easy read before bed to relax your body and switch off your mind. Logically, a ‘high voltage’ film or book before bed will not be the best option to relax you.</p>
<p>If you are a ‘night-time worrier’- keep a notebook by your bed.  Write down your thoughts and read them in the morning. Always action these or reflect on them to help you to relax the next night.</p>
<h4>Your daily life choices influence your night-time rest</h4>
<p>Napping during the day is often part of sleep problems at night.  If you can, aim for a maximum of half an hour in the morning or straight after lunch. Late afternoon or early evening sleeps can be especially disruptive to sleeping at night.</p>
<p>Your mind may be tired, but is your body may not be.  Carrying out daily exercises to raise your heartbeat for at least 30 minutes can help, but this should take place in the morning or early in the afternoon. Aerobic exercise just before bed can really wake you up. Try yoga classes, pilates or a good walk.</p>
<h4>How what you eat can influence how you sleep:</h4>
<p>The sleep chemicals in your body are made from your food. Increasing the supply of serotonin and melatonin can help you sleep and the main building block for serotonin and melatonin is called tryptophan. It is contained in protein including: chicken, turkey, fish, prawns and soya beans- so aim for a portion of these once a day.</p>
<p>Tryptophan is not available as a supplement but as 5-HTP which is easily converted into tryptophan. If you have made the dietary changes recommended without results &#8211; you may want to consider supplementing 5-HTP under the supervision of a nutritional therapist and your GP.  Take before bed with a small glass of fruit juice or a small oat biscuit to aid absorption.</p>
<p>Tryptophan is carried into the brain by insulin, released into the blood after you have eaten carbohydrates. So light meals including a piece of chicken breast with vegetables and a small jacket potato can really help your body to make the chemicals that promote sleep.</p>
<p>Beware: dairy and soy products are some the least tolerated types of food! Wheat, yeast and eggs are also common irritants. Food intolerances may be disrupting your digestive system, and it is worth ruling out food intolerances to help tackle a sleep problem.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for waking in the night can be that the body is suffering from very low blood sugar levels. This is often true if you find yourself waking up very early in the morning. What is happening is that your body has woken up in a state of panic, your blood sugar levels having crashed so far down that it wakes you up with an ‘emergency’. Once awake, the associated adrenaline rush keeps you awake. To help to stabilise your blood sugar LINK – How to avoid the 3 o’clock slump.  <strong>A light snack</strong> before bedtime containing protein and carbohydrate can get you through the night try: houmous and oatcakes, unsweetened muesli and yogurt or a small bowl of porridge. This is different from eating a large meal late at night&#8230;..</p>
<p>Eating a rich, spicy, large meal late at night can reduce your chances of sleeping well.  Eat at least three hours before bedtime and aim for your main meal to be earlier in the day. Also be aware that red meats and cheeses contain high levels of a protein that wakes your brain up, so do not over indulge in these close to bedtime.</p>
<p>Some people are very sensitive to caffeine, and even small amounts can stop them sleeping. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, chocolate and colas. One or two cups of coffee or tea are fine, aim to make these as early in the day as possible. AVOID caffeine after dinner. There are many calming hot drinks on the market. Try chamomile, peppermint, ginger or blended teas designed for night time as a bedtime drink. Decaffeinated green tea also contains calming properties.</p>
<p>AVOID alcohol if you want to sleep well. Alcohol can cause a release of adrenaline, the body’s emergency hormone – and therefore is not conducive to feeling sleepy. Alcohol can of course put you to sleep, but a good, uninterrupted night’s sleep is less likely following a glass of alcohol.</p>
<p>Support your body with the nutrients needed to convert tryptophan to serotonin and melatonin. Particularly important are: <a title="Calcium" href="http://life.seven-seas.com/calcium">calcium</a>, <a title="Magnesium" href="http://life.seven-seas.com/magnesium">magnesium,</a> <a title="Vitamin B6" href="http://life.seven-seas.com/vitamin-b6">Vitamin B6</a>,  <a title="Vitamin B3" href="http://life.seven-seas.com/vitamin-b3">Vitamin B3</a>, <a title="Folic Acid" href="http://life.seven-seas.com/folic-acid">Folic acid</a>, <a title="Vitamin C" href="http://life.seven-seas.com/vitamin-c">vitamin C</a>.</p>
<p>Magnesium is a natural relaxant and you could consider supplementing this before bedtime under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner.</p>
<p>Herbal sleep aids area available and could be considered, the most popular are Valerian, Passionflower and Hops<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h4>So what should I do to sleep well?</h4>
<p>If you do struggle with getting to sleep or sustaining good quality sleep, follow the advice above. There are many support websites on this issue &#8211; have a look at www.sleepfoundation.org for more information. Being unable to sleep may however be indicative of a serious underlying health problem or that your medication is disrupting your body’s balance. It is vital that you discuss your sleep issues with your doctor and if you feel that you are not well, or something is just not right, insist on thorough testing in that health area. Taking prescription sleep aids is up to you, however giving yourself the best chance of sleeping with the advice above seems like a good way to start.</p>
