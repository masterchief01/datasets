          So it should be self-evident, if you are following this at all, that 
          the people you want to have sex with the most will be at the top of 
          the ladder. Descending down to the bottom of the ladder we pass the 
          following people:<br>
          <br>
          1. The people we really want, who may even be out of our league, are 
          on top.<br>
          2. Then come the people we like.<br>
          3. Moving further down we pass the people who we would fuck if we were 
          intoxicated and would admit to doing it later.<br>
          4. At the bottom are the people we would fuck drunk, and would lie about 
          doing it later.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clinging 
          to the bottom are the girls that are wolf ugly. These are women so ugly 
          you would chew your own arm off to get away rather than fuck them. Usually 
          fake teeth, or the loss of several hundred pounds can move a woman up 
          from wolf ugly.<br>
          <br>
          Now let's take a look at what the typical woman's ladder looks like:<br>
          <br>
          <img src="images/womansladder1.jpg" width="244" height="310"> <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first 
          thing to notice here is that a woman has not one ,but two ladders. This 
          is becasue in addition the normal ladder, a woman also has a friends 
          ladder. The friends ladder is where a woman puts guys that she considers 
          &quot;just friends&quot;. More to the point where she puts guys who 
          don't get to have sex with her.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem 
          arises because a woman never lets a guy know which ladder he is on. 
          Obviously there is a huge difference, or gap between these two ladders. 
          It is in this gap that kisses of death are delivered and intellectual 
          whores are made. All a man can do is &quot;go for it&quot; and make 
          a move on a girl; ask her out, try to kiss her, write her a love note 
          or whatever. If he's on the good ladder fine. If he is on the friends 
          ladder this is a case of ladder jumping. The man is trying to jump the 
          gap from the friends ladder to the real ladder. The girl has two choices 
          at this point: she can let him on the ladder and all is well, or, more 
          likely, she can kick him in the head, and off the ladder. If you look 
          you'll see that below the ladder is the Abyss(what was it Nietzsche 
          said about a man being on a rope stretched over an Abyss?....well it's 
          worse than he thought; there is no rope.) So the man falls into the 
          Abyss. The Abyss isn't really as bad as it sounds. Mostly it's a period 
          of self-loathing, embarrassment, and of course utter awkwardness with 
          the girl in question if they are talking at all.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To fully 
          illustrate the point I'll now examine some common scenarios and their 
          ladder theory explanations. For purposes of these examples Tom will 
          be our boy and Jane will be out girl.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">Scenario 
          1:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Tom meets Jane. She's pretty and seems interesting to talk to. Tom and 
          Jane start haging out and talking more and more. Tom develops an attraction 
          to Jane, and one day tries to kiss her. Jane tell Tom she doesn't think 
          of him that way and she wants to remain friends. The next few weeks 
          contact between the two falls off. Jane starts fucking an outlaw biker.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6600FF">Ladder 
          Theory Explanation:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Tom met Jane. Tom was immediately placed on the friends ladder. Tom 
          didn't know this. Tom tried to jump ladders. Jane kicked Tom in the 
          head rather than let him on and sent him hurtling to the Abyss below. 
          The oulaw biker was not on her friends ladder (they never are) but rather 
          on her good ladder.</font><br>
          <br>
          <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">Scenario 
          2:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Tom meets Jane. She's cute and seems smart. After an appropriate amount 
          of time he asks her out on a date. She acccepts and they have what seems 
          to be a perfectly nice date. Tom thinks he has a chance with Jane. He 
          asks her out again. She says no, either explicitly or by never returning 
          his phone call. Tom has no idea what the Hell just happened. Jane starts 
          fucking an unemployed alcoholic.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#6600FF">Ladder 
          Theory Explanation:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Jane misrepresented which ladder Tom was on. He thought he was on the 
          good ladder because of her acceptance of the date. Mistake. This led 
          to an unintentional ladder jump. He was kicked into the Abyss. In this 
          situation, Jane often wants to stay friends becasue you are so interesting 
          and funny or some shit like that. If this happens you are most likely 
          an Intellectual Whore. I'm sorry. This is most likely to be a ninja-bitch.</font><br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">Scenario 
          3:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          A girl says any of the following to you:</font><br>

          &#149; &quot;I feel like I can talk to you about anything&quot;<br>
          &#149; &quot;You're so nice&quot;<br>
          &#149; &quot;Can you help me with my homework&quot;<br>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can 
          see that a lot of problems can be avoided(though sadly not problem two) 
          by declaring as soon as possible to a girl that you will not be friends 
          under any circumstances. You can explain that she is too attractive 
          or you can be blunt and say you don't want to bend your &quot;friends&quot; 
          over a table and fuck them, but would rather play poker and go to the 
          races with them, thus disqualifying her from friendship. As long as 
          you are clear. This may scare a girl away. But if it does what would 
          you want with such a skittish little twit anyway?.<br>
