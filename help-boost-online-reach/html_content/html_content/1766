"I would be all over the  ball, and my approach was different from normal kids. A lot of kids  would back away. They would be afraid of the ball.

<p>Spud's older brother, David, is known as Bean. It's intriguing to  think for a moment of a family named exclusively after vegetables, but  this isn't the case.</p> <p>"When I was born, my head looked like a bean so they called me  Beanhead," says 22-year-old David, who works in the family store, Webb's  Soul Market, in Dallas. Bean notes that his three sisters and his other  brother, Reginald, have no nicknames. "But Spud isn't named after a  potato. I know people think that. When he was born, see, he had this big  ol' bald head. People called him Sputnik-head, after that satellite the  Russians put in orbit. That's where Spud comes from. But now, when Spud  jumps, he really is in orbit."</p>

<p>Robinson's given name was Walker Smith Jr. He was born in Detroit on  May 3, 1921. He moved with his family to New York, where he grew up in  Harlem. As a teen-age amateur boxer representing the Salem-Crescent gym,  he borrowed the Amateur Athletic Union card of another Harlem youngster  named Ray Robinson. Once his Sugar Ray nickname stuck, he never used  his real name.</p> <p>''Sugar Ray Robinson had a nice ring to it,'' he once said. ''Sugar Walker Smith wouldn't have been the same.''</p>
</blockquote><p>And yes, he was the original "Sugar Ray."</p>

It  was either given to him at age 12 by a reporter or when he was in  college at LSU. It was either because of his shooting motion (from the  hip, like unholstering a pistol) or because of his dead-eye accuracy.  But, like all good legends, it makes no difference, as Maravich will  always be the supreme talent and showman known simply as Pistol.<br><br></p></blockquote>

						<p><strong>Time Period Nicknames:</strong> Would a nickname like the "Brown Bomber" be considered appropriate today?</p><p>Truthfully, I'm not so sure it would be. It had a nice ring to it (alliteration will do that), and <a href="http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016109.html">given Louis' popularity</a>, I would like to think the emphasis was more on distinguishing him for the "bomber" rather than the "brown" aspect of the nickname.</p><p>And yet, in looking back at the time period, perhaps it is important to distinguish the "brown" of the nickname. Louis was the first black athlete to reach hero status to whites and blacks alike, and was a symbol of power within the black community.

						<p><strong>Originality:</strong> Huge creativity points here: <a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-nickname-game-lou-gehrig/">The story goes</a> that Native Americans used to describe locomotives as "iron horses" given the size and strength of the trains. The press transferred the name to Gehrig, and it stuck.</p><p><strong>Iconic: </strong>Like Gehrig the ballplayer, this nickname has probably been underrated throughout history. And like Gehrig the ballplayer, it is one of the best in baseball history.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Appropriate: </strong>One man in baseball history was more durable than Lou Gehrig. But Cal Ripken, Jr. was not more powerful, that much is for certain. "The Iron Horse" fit perfectly.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>My Personal Version of This Nickname: </strong>The Iron Discourse.<strong><br></strong></p>

						<p><strong>Originality:</strong> There have been "docs" throughout history, so this one isn't the most original. Still, as many "docs" as there are out there, there is only one doctor.</p><p><strong>Iconic: </strong>Dr. J gets a ton of points in this category because of how iconic his nickname is. Most people don't call him Julius Erving&mdash;he's always Dr. J.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Appropriate: </strong>It doesn't really apply to an aspect of his game, and was actually a nickname his childhood friend Leon Saunders gave him. <a href="http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/erv0int-1">Here's the story</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I used to call him the Professor because, when we would do  anything, whether it was playing basketball, or cards, or just sitting  around and shooting the breeze, he always had to have the upper hand.   He could outtalk anybody, to the point where he would lecture whoever  else was around, if we were willing to listen. I just kind of dubbed him  the Professor one day. And he said, "Well, if I'm the Professor, then  you're the Doctor." We kind of had professional-sounding nicknames, and  we just shared that amongst ourselves.</p></blockquote>

From the <a href="http://www.shoelessjoejackson.com/about/facts.html">"Shoeless" Joe Jackson website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>He received his nickname "Shoeless,"                        after playing a minor league game in his stockings because                        a new pair of spikes had given him blisters on his feet                        the previous day.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Mays came to the majors, he didn't know everyone's name right away.</p> <p>"You see a guy, you say, 'Hey, man. Say hey, man,' " Mays said. "Ted was  the 'Splinter'. Joe was 'Joltin' Joe'. Stan was 'The Man'. I guess I hit a few  home runs, and they said there goes the 'Say Hey Kid.' "</p> <p>Mays credits sportswriter Jimmy Cannon with creating the nickname. Other  sources trace it to sportswriter Barney Kremenko.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Iconic: </strong>As iconic as they get.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Appropriate: </strong>It doesn't really describe his actual game in any way, so not in that regard.

						<p><strong>Originality:</strong> Georgia is known for its peaches. Cobb was born in Georgia and was one hell of a ballplayer. It was a good fit.</p><p><strong>Iconic: </strong>Certainly.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Appropriate: </strong>Cobb may have been a "peach" of a ballplayer, but he was anything but as a human being. <a href="http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014142.html">Per ESPN, Cobb</a> was "a southern Protestant who hated northerners,  Catholics, blacks and apparently anybody else who was different from him."</p><p>I can certainly see if some people take issue with this being ranked so high, but I always loved this nickname for the irony it evokes.</p>
