				<h2><a href="http://www.pure-krill-oil.com/health-benefits/">Health Benefits Associated with Krill Oil</a></h2>
				
				<p>Though studies have been conducted on krill for quite some time, it is only recently that people have been purchasing it to deal with a variety of symptoms and medical conditions. Though much more research is needed as to disprove or prove that it actually helps certain conditions, early research indicates that krill oil may be a useful supplement to add to many people’s regular routine.</p>
<p><strong>Krill Oil and Cholesterol </strong></p>
<p>It is a fact that many people suffer with some form of cardiovascular disease or another in the United States alone. The University of Montreal and McGill University researchers found in one double-blind trial that following a regimen of 1.5 grams of krill oil per day lowered the bad cholesterol or LDL by over 30%. The increase in the good levels of cholesterol or HDL went up as high as 43%. Such findings can be good news for those with high cholesterol that are currently taking prescription medication and would prefer to take a more natural approach to treat their condition.</p>
<p><strong>Krill Oil and Its Effects on Adult ADD</strong></p>
<p>Another breakthrough study has shown that adults diagnosed with ADD when taking a daily dose of 500mg of krill oil improved their ability to manage their money by more than 30%, increased their concentration ability by more than 50% and improved their overall planning skills by at least 50%. The study was conducted by the Miami Shores’ Barry University and clinics for naturopath care in Quebec and Montreal, Canada. The studies were conducted in cooperation with International Association of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The results were evaluated by the Barkley’s Executive Function measurements for executive function, self control and the inhibition of behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Krill Oil and Arthritis and Chronic Inflammation</strong></p>
<p>Those that suffer with artery destruction from atherosclerosis, chronic inflammation of the joints due to osteoarthritis as well as rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease may have found relief in the daily consumption of krill oil. Luisa Duetsch, MD of the J Am College of Nutrition did an evaluation of the effects of using krill oil for these conditions. It showed using the WOMAC scoring system that those patients that used krill oil reduced their pain by more than 25%, reduced their stiffness by over 20% and had a decrease in functional impairment of more than 22% after just 7 days. No adverse effects were reported and no pain relievers except acetaminophen were used. It was also reported that the use of acetaminophen was considerably lesser than before using krill oil.</p>
<p><strong>Krill Oil and Anti-Aging</strong></p>
<p>Studies conducted using ORAC or Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity showed that krill oil has an ORAC value said to be 300 times as high as Vitamins E or A. ORAC values measure a variety of nutrients to ascertain their antioxidant power. Krill oil is said to have the ability to repair cells that are aging. Those women that took krill oil for 3 months reported they had an increase in stamina, concentration, memory, alertness and energy of more than 50%. They also reported they had a reduction of aches and pains of more than 30%.</p>
<p>Woman also reported that their skin, nails and hair improved in the areas of texture and appearance as well as reducing skin problems, redness and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by almost 60%.</p>
<p><strong>PMS and Krill Oil</strong></p>
<p>JSS Medical Research Inc. showed in their data analysis that the use of krill oil significantly lessened the effects of Premenstrual Syndrome. It was shown to work on the pain and inflammation along with the psychological and emotional symptoms associated with Premenstrual Syndrome by having a favorable effect on the brain’s neurotransmitters.</p>
<p><strong>Other Conditions that Might Benefit from Taking Krill Oil</strong></p>
<p>There are currently studies that are looking to see if krill oil can benefit a variety of other medical conditions. Some of the conditions are Autoimmune Murine Lupus, skin cancer as well as dyslipidemia. Results of the studies may show that krill oil taken on a daily basis can improve and protect against these conditions.</p>
