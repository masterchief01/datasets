<!-- ALL ADSENSE ADS DISABLED -->
<p>Want flatter abs, less stress, unforgettable sex? Here are the keys to all this and more.</p>
<p>Eat sweets to curb a sugar craving? Overcome exercise inertia by writing a letter? Who knew? Insiders that&#8217;s who! We combed through the research to uncover the single most important thing you need to know about everything &#8211; from whittling your middle to picking a weight-loss plan that you&#8217;ll actually stick to. Go ahead and pass these tips along. After all, some secrets are just too juicy to keep to your-self.</p>
<p><strong>1. Picking the Right Diet for You</strong></p>
<p><u>Look For Your Favorite Foods.</u> &#8220;An obvious but often overlooked point is that the best diet is one you&#8217;ll stick to &#8211; not a hyped-to-the-hilt plan or the strategy that helped your pal drop 10 pounds,&#8221; says Lisa Sanders, M.D., an assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine and author of The Perfect Fit Diet: How to Lose Weight, Keep It Off and Still Have the Foods You Love. &#8220;If you adore fruit or pasta, for example, a high Â¬protein regimen is a recipe for failure. â€œRemember, that a diet is a way of life rather than a quick fix &#8211; and it&#8217;s hard to live with a plan that keeps you away from the things you love.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2. Reaching Any Health Goal</strong></p>
<p><u>Write A Letter To A Loved One.</u> Michael George, Los Angeles-based trainer and author of Body Express Make over offers this tip: &#8220;List every excuse you can think of for not taking care of yourself. Then explain why these unhealthy habits may mean you won&#8217;t be around for this person in the future. Rather than sending the note, keep it nearby to read when your motivation wanes. In addition to making you accountable for your actions, it will remind you that the changes you&#8217;re making will prolong your life and the amount of time you&#8217;ll be able to spend with friends and family.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Firming Up Really Fast</strong></p>
<p><u>Be Unrealistic.</u> Pretend to be a celebrity with a big event coming up in three weeks. Commit to an intensive programme that combines six days a week of cardio and/or strength training with healthy eating. A 21-day period is doable, and it&#8217;s enough time to see an increase in definition and endurance and for muscle memory to set in. So even though you&#8217;ve officially &#8216;completed&#8217; your programme, you&#8217;ll be inspired to keep going.</p>
<p><strong>4. Heading off a Hangover</strong></p>
<p><u>Set Your Alarm For An Hour Before You Need To Get Up.</u> Then take 800 milligrams of ibuprofen and go back to bed, advises David J. Clayton, M.D., coauthor of The Healthy Guide to Unhealthy Living. Though twice the overÂ¬ the-counter dose, it&#8217;s a safe amount to take occasionally (provided you don&#8217;t have kidney disease or ulcers). The drug targets inflammation, which can cause hangover symptoms like head and body aches. Spending that hour in bed -even if you don&#8217;t fall back asleep &#8211; gives the drug time to work and allows you to start your day refreshed instead of flagging.</p>
<p><strong>5. Your Flattest Abs Ever</strong></p>
<p><u>Keep the Contraction Constant While Doing Crunches.</u> â€œWhen you lower back and head to the floor between each move, you rely on your hip flexors or upper back, rather than your abs, to bring your body back up,â€ says David Kirsch, founder of the Madison Square Club in New York City and author of the Ultimate New York Body Plan. â€œMaking the movement small and tight keeps abdominal muscles active, which maximizes the burn-and your result.â€</p>
<p><strong>6. Recovering From a Health Crisis</strong></p>
<p><u>Focus On The Positive.</u> &#8220;Whether you&#8217;re on the mend from a broken leg or in remission from cancer, it&#8217;s actually physiologically helpful to consider what you&#8217;ve gained from the experience, â€œsays Larry Dossey, M.D., author of The Extraordinary Healing Power of Ordinary Things. &#8220;Did you discover a strength you didn&#8217;t know you had? Find out which of your friends could be counted on in a crunch &#8211; and which ones aren&#8217;t as reliable as you thought?&#8221; While an optimistic outlook isn&#8217;t a cure-all, studies show that people with one have greater resistance to disease, recover faster and live longer. If you have trouble seeing the upside now, surround yourself with people who do. Then try this exercise: On a piece of paper, draw two columns. Write down all your pessimistic thoughts on your health on the left and balance each with a positive statement on the right. Tear away the negative column and hang the optimistic list on your fridge to glance at throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>7. Greater Agility</strong></p>
<p><u>Defy Inertia</u>. Agility requires balance, quick reactions, and body control &#8211; all skills that can be systematically improved. Try these moves:</p>
<p>â€¢ The T drill measures your ability to change directions while you&#8217;re moving at your top speed. Set up cones or towels in the form of a T on a playground. Start at the base of the T, sprint to the top, side shuffle 5metres to the left, side shuffle 10metres to the right,  side shuffle 5metres back to the middle, and then backpedal down the stem.</p>
<p>â€¢ Push your limits. Find a partner and stand facing each other, 15 feet apart. Ask him to run forward, backward, and side-to-side randomly for 15 seconds. Your task: Mirror him. Do six sets resting for 45 seconds after each, every other day. After 2 weeks, add two sets.</p>
<p>â€¢ Improve your footwork. Mark off 10 consecutive 2-foot squares with tape. Now, hop as fast as you can through the squares for 10 seconds. Mix it up &#8211; one-and two-legged hops, forward, backward, and sideways &#8211; each time through. Do 10 sets, resting for 45 seconds after each, several times a week.</p>
<p><strong>8. Strong Legs and a Toned Butt</strong></p>
<p><u>Get a Leg Up.</u> Life one foot an inch or two off the floor as you do your dead-lifts, dumbbell shoulder presses or biceps curls; switch legs before you begin the next set. This helps train and strengthen the leg&#8217;s smaller, deeper stabilizing muscles, which will I make legs look more sculpted,&#8221; advises Chris UY, fitness manager at the sports Club/LA in New York City. â€œYouâ€™ll also burn more calories than you would working both legs simultaneously.â€</p>
<p><strong>9. Overcoming Fear</strong></p>
<p>Do A Dry Run Of Whatever Spooks You. Try the Following 5 Steps:</p>
<p>â€¢ <u>Recognize the feeling</u>. The next time you feel anxious, understand that fear, not stress is causing your anxiety. Identifying what&#8217;s triggering your fear will help you handle it better.</p>
<p>â€¢ <u>Slow down.</u> Quick breathing sends a signal to your body to speed things up &#8211; which can contribute to anxiety. So often, throughout the day, zero in on your breath just as you would do in yoga class, lengthening each inhale and exhale and concentrating on the path of air as it travels through your body. You&#8217;ll feel more focused and less flustered in seconds.</p>
<p>â€¢ <u>Imagine yourself in the stressful situation then mentally create the tone of voice, attitude, and actions you want to display.</u> Then act out what you&#8217;ve been visualizing. Play the role of the confident, relaxed man. It&#8217;ll help you learn new strategies for dealing with fear. Practicing the perfect response helps establish pathways in the brain that become self-fulfilling.</p>
<p>â€¢ <u>Confront the fear deliberately.</u> No matter how much training you do, if you wait for 	fear to present itself, it will always have the advantage of surprise. So it&#8217;s better to face it on your terms. Fear heights? Join a gym that offers Wall Climbing classes. Through baby steps you&#8217;ll learn to address the fear by prodding that quivering mass out of the shadows, where you can deal with it better.</p>
<p>â€¢ <u>Get help.</u> It&#8217;s doubly tough to face fear alone. Find someone (a spouse, a buddy, a therapist) you can discuss your worry/fright with, and seek advice. A true friend will support your efforts to beat 	the fear that&#8217;s bothering you, and tell you when you&#8217;re being a misguided wimp. If there&#8217;s no one like this in your life, no wonder you&#8217;re so stressed.</p>
<p><strong>10. Longer Lasting Teeth</strong></p>
<p><u>Lighten Up On Your Pearly Whites.</u> &#8220;Brushing your teeth does not require a lot of force,&#8221; says Atlanta based Ronald Goldstein, D.D.S author of Change Your Smile. Doing so Will erode the enamel (the outer covering of the teeth) and cause the gum tissue to recede. And would reveal the much softer cementum (covering the root which may lead to an increased chance of sensitivity, decay, and to deformity. How can you tell if youâ€™re brushing too hard? Check your brush If the bristles are frayed or splayed after a few months&#8217; use, you may b offender. Your brush should look pretty much the same after 6 month as it did when you bought it. Likewise flossing is healthy, but not if you garrote your gums. Move floss gently under the gums to nab food particles then up down each side of the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>11. Preventing Workout Injuries</strong></p>
<p><u>Train The Way You Need Your Body To Move In Life.</u> &#8220;Constantly doing basic exercises the same way -lunges and squats, for instance &#8211; creates muscle imbalances that can lead to injury,&#8221; warns Alden Mills, former U.S. Navy SEAL officer and creator of Body Rev, a functional fitness weight system. To counter this, it&#8217;s crucial to engage muscles you use on an everyday basis in your fitness routine &#8211; even if it&#8217;s just during your warm-up. As you rise from a squat, lift a ball over your head and then lower it slightly with arms straight, as you might if you were putting a box of groceries on a high shelf.</p>
<p><strong>12. Looking Fab in Photos</strong></p>
<p><u>Don&#8217;t Just Pose Do Something!</u> Movement adds energy to the photo and can help you look less stiff and feel more comfortable. Tell the photographer to put on some music you love before shooting so that you can begin camping it up like a pro. Look over your shoulder, twirl your skirt, and lift your child high in the air. Pretend you&#8217;re on Candid Camera.</p>
<p><strong>13. Getting Out Of the Gym Faster</strong></p>
<p><u>Combination Exercises.</u> Two or more moves blended together &#8211; work a ton of muscle mass and save time. Try this exercise.<br />
Rotational Reach-and-Touch Lunge to Curl and Press Stand holding dumbbells at your sides. With your left leg, lunge forward and to the left at a 45-degree angle.</p>
<p>â€¢ As you bend your knee to lower your body, reach with both arms and touch the weights to the floor, one on each side of your left foot.<br />
â€¢ As you push yourself up, curl the weights to your shoulders.<br />
â€¢ Then press them overhead.<br />
â€¢ Return to the starting position. That&#8217;s one repetition. Repeat for a total of eight to 10, alternating legs as you go.</p>
<p><strong>14. Not Fainting When Having a Blood Test</strong></p>
<p><u>Tense your Muscles.</u> &#8220;Simultaneously contracting the muscles in your arms, legs, torso and neck can apply enough external pressure to blood-vessel walls to prevent the drop in blood pressure that causes fainting,&#8221; says Mark Watling, M.D., coauthor of Overcoming Medical Phobias.</p>
<p>Do this exercise in sets of five, five times a day (hold each contraction for 10 seconds), and so you can become familiar enough with the technique to apply it at the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p><strong>15. Getting Promoted</strong></p>
<p><u>Ask To Shoulder Some Of Your Boss&#8217; Chores.</u> Many losers believe they deserve a promotion simply because they&#8217;ve been around long enough and management should be loyal to them. That&#8217;s a load of junk. What counts is production, consistency, and drive. If you want your work to be noticed by the boss, take on some of the stuff that he hates, and in which you can shine &#8211; maybe writing out the financial report of the last quarter. Thatâ€™ll leave him time to focus on the things he really cares about. He won&#8217;t forget the favour when April rolls around, and it&#8217;s time to discuss raises.</p>
<p><strong>16. Getting a Solid Answer from a Hard-to-pin-down Person<br />
</strong><br />
<u> Ask A Solid Question.</u> &#8220;Many times, we&#8217;re afraid to hear the word no, so we make wishy-washy queries,&#8221; says Misha Henckel, Los Angeles-based life coach. Pose your question so there&#8217;s no room for anything but a yes or no response &#8211; e.g., &#8216;Am I in the running for that job?&#8217; &#8216;Can you fix my computer today?&#8217; While unpleasant to hear, a no will at least enable you to move on with your life.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>17. Becoming a Smart Lover</strong></p>
<p><u>Don&#8217;t Sell Yourself Short.</u> Agonizing about your penis size? Stop worrying and start focusing on your technique. For instance, piston like porno thrusting feels horrible to a woman. It can leave her dry, sore, and bored. Instead, make the most of what you have by using powerful, deep thrusts at a slow-to-medium pace, Add side-to-side movement, or up-and-down pelvic pressure against her clitoris when you&#8217;re all the way inside, to vary the stimulation.</p>
<p><strong>18. A Bigger Bang</strong></p>
<p>Change Track thinking about politics or the weather to put off the climax tends to kill the moment entirely and the oft-cited stop- tart technique can leave her hanging. Instead, try thinking about other ways of pleasuring her. When you feel your point of no return approaching &#8211; it&#8217;s technically called &#8220;ejaculatory inevitability&#8221; &#8211; treats it as a cue to start stimulating her in a different way. Massage her clitoris with your fingers. Or, while inside her, press against it with the part of your abdomen just above your penis. Or stop and give her oral for a while. If you&#8217;re smooth with your movements, she&#8217;ll have no idea you&#8217;re just trying to regulate your ejaculation, all you have to do is let your system settle from its excited point.</p>
<p><strong>19. Curbing a Sugar Craving</strong></p>
<p><u>Don&#8217;t Beat It -Eat It!</u> &#8220;Your urge may be biological or psychological, but either way, deprivation only aggravates it. Give yourself permission to eat the, particular sweet you crave and it will lose some of its power over you,&#8221; offers Susan Mcquillan, RD., author of breaking the Bonds of Food Addiction. Fight the temptation to overeat by buying only small packets or learn to share. Take a reasonably sized portion out of the bag or box and give away the rest immediately.</p>
<p><strong>20. Curing Sinus Trouble</strong></p>
<p><u>Toss Your Pillow.</u> Your bedding may be harboring millions off fungi, reveals a study from the University of Manchester in England. Aspergillus fumigatus, the species found most commonly in pillows, can worsen asthma, particularly in adults who&#8217;ve had it for many years, and cause allergic sinusitis in those with allergic tendencies. When you buy a new pillow, consider one with real silk cotton, as more fungi were found in the synthetic variety.</p>
<p><strong>21. Solving a Problem</strong></p>
<p><u>Lie Down.</u> In a study from the Australian National University Psychologist Darren M. Lipnicki found that people come up with solutions to puzzles faster when supine. Your body may produce less nor-adrenaline, a hormone that can raise anxiety and interfere with creative thinking.</p>
<p><strong>22. A Healthier Heart</strong></p>
<p><u>Take A Break.</u> The Framingham Heart Study found that people who took vacations cut their chance of a fatal heart attack compared with those who took no time off. Another study found that woman who took breaks only once in two years were more likely to experience depression, tension and fatigue versus those who took breaks twice or more yearly. Vacationing is essential for relieving stress and boosting creativity, and it typically takes two to three days before your brain disengages from work, says Kathleen Hall, author of A Life in Balance: Nourishing the Four Roots of True Happiness. &#8220;Mini breaks can help, but one to two weeks is ideal,&#8221; she says. If you can&#8217;t take that much time, start with a few days and travel nearby; or stay at home, learning to knit or starting some kind of project. &#8220;Get out of your usual schedule and have a new experience,&#8221; says Hall.</p>
