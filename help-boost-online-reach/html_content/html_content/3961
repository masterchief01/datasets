I woke up Sunday morning craving oatmeal raisin cookies <i>something fierce</i>, so I tried to make myself eat oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar in it for breakfast but that didn&#8217;t work, and so there was nothing left to do but to bake cookies. My life is <i>so</i> hard, innit?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3292554483/" title="craggy batter"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3461/3292554483_5561133e29.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="craggy batter" /></a></p>
<p>I have very specific tastes in oatmeal raisin cookies. A crisp edge is always welcome, but the rest of it must be thick and chewy. Just to confuse, this is unlike other oatmeal cookie recipes on this site, the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/oatmeal-chocolate-chip-and-pecan-cookies/">crunchier chocolate chip pecan version</a> and the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/05/crispy-salted-oatmeal-white-chocolate-cookies/">thick but shattery, salty white chocolate version</a>. Nope, my oatmeal raisin cookies demand their own texture, and one I can&#8217;t get from those other recipes.</p>
<p><span id="more-2046"></span></p>
<p>I start with the standard recipe on every can of Quaker oats and then start making it better. I find it too sweet, so I dial back the sugar. It never has enough raisins in it, so I up them. I use only brown sugar (instead of a mix of brown and white). And sometimes, though not this one, I add chopped walnuts because they were made to go together.</p>
<p>And then I try not to eat them for breakfast. (It&#8217;s got oats and dried fruit, right? Like granola!) I, uh, don&#8217;t always succeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3292551303/" title="thick, chewy cookies"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3468/3292551303_127db7772c.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="thick, chewy cookies" /></a>
<p><b>Thick, Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</b></p>
<p>The last trick to getting a really thick, chewy cookie is to chill the dough before you bake it. You can scoop it and then chill it, or, if you&#8217;re like us, scoop it, freeze them and store them in a freezer bag so you can bake them as you wish. I find they&#8217;re always thicker when baked from the cold &#8212; only a couple extra minutes baking is needed.</p>
<p>This is a half recipe. It makes a couple dozen standard-size cookies. (I get more because I make them tinier.) I always feel like I&#8217;m swimming in cookies when I make the full volume, but if you&#8217;re feeding a crowd, go ahead and double it.</p>
<p>1/2 cup (1 stick or 4 ounces)  butter, softened<br />
2/3 cup light brown sugar, packed<br />
1 egg<br />
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt (I often use a half teaspoon, but I like more salt in my baked goods)<br />
1 1/2 cups rolled oats<br />
3/4 cup raisins<br />
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350&#176;F (175&#176;C).</p>
<p>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, egg and vanilla until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt together. Stir this into the butter/sugar mixture. Stir in the oats, raisins and walnuts, if using them.</p>
<p>At this point you can either chill the dough for a bit in the fridge and then scoop it, or scoop the cookies onto a sheet and then chill the whole tray before baking them. You could also bake them right away, if you&#8217;re impatient, but I do find that they end up slighly less thick.</p>
<p>The cookies should be two inches apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake them for 10 to 12 minutes (your baking time will vary, depending on your oven and how cold the cookies were going in), taking them out when golden at the edges but still a little undercooked-looking on top. Let them sit on the hot baking sheet for five minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool.</p>

				<p>I have to disagree with you. Baked raisins just ruin a perfectly good oatmeal cookie! I&#8217;ll forgive you though, because I LOVE everything I&#8217;ve ever made from your site. Keep em&#8217; coming!</p>

				<p>Ironic that I was just reading a magazine tip about how to get perfectly textured cookies.   On my counter right now (waiting because I am one egg short) are the fixin&#8217;s for some awesome monster cookies.  These need 4.5 cups of oats, but only .5 cup sugar.  They also include MELTED butter and corn syrup.   It&#8217;s the strangest cookie recipe ever, but they turn out so beautifully!</p>

				<p>I agree that more raisins—or dried apricots, cranberries, or even prunes—improve cookies. </p>
<p>After moving to Colorado, I&#8217;m having to learn how to bake at altitude. With minor adjustments, your recipes work fine, surely a sign of great recipes.</p>

				<p>Agreed, the chilling is important. Not eating them for breakfast—less important :)</p>
<p>This is pretty similar to my family recipe, though ours adds unsweetened cocoa. Not enough to be chocolatey, just enough for spice.</p>

				<p>I too am a sucker for thick and chewy oatmeal cookies. I don&#8217;t make them too often because my husband isn&#8217;t a big fan, but maybe I&#8217;m looking at it backwards and the fact that he doesn&#8217;t love them means I should make them very often indeed! More for me.</p>

				<p>I like your site since it has good recipes for trying once in a while.  However, I often wonder about your health.  It looks like you consume too much butter, sugar and other unhealthy stuff.

				<p>Funny. I have always used the Quaker recipe as well but with almost the identical modifications from the less, and all brown, sugar, to the extra salt. I also have found that mini chocolate chips (the only time I ever use them) are an excellent substitution when you aren&#8217;t pretending to be healthy. They&#8217;re so tiny that instead of being chocolate chip-y they melt and suffuse the whole cookie with chocolate goodness.</p>

				<p>This is just the way I love oatmeal cookies; a mounded cookie of oats in a toffee base with raisins and finely chopped toasted walnuts.  For a chocolate craving..I use Raisinettes.  Oh, Mama!  Those are nearly perfect.  Oatmeal cookies need salt so don&#8217;t skimp there.  You  should be able to taste it..IMO.</p>

				<p>Hi Andrea &#8212; Thanks for your concern. About my health. I don&#8217;t entertain conversations about healthy eating on this site because I don&#8217;t subscribe to any belief system besides moderation. Baking buttery, sugary cookies and having a couple isn&#8217;t a problem. Eating an entire pan of them is. </p>
<p>Less clear perhaps from a reader&#8217;s view might be that we usually bake half and quarter quantities of sweets, and then share them with friends. The foods we eat entirely on our own are the beans and vegetable-based dishes that populate the other 50 percent of this site.</p>

				<p>Drool.  I just baked oatmeal chocolate chip cookies over the weekend&#8211; am a fan of the brown sugar-only version, and chewy texture.  BF likes them slightly crispier, so I alternate between batches&#8230; or at least try.  :-)</p>

				<p>Our favorite is pretty much the Quaker Oats recipe too, with dried cherries, chocolate chips and chopped pecans. We also use all brown sugar, or add some molasses if we&#8217;re out of brown sugar. I created them when our hometown hockey team, The Hurricanes, first made it to the Stanley Cup finals, in 2002. I christened the cookies Hurricane cookies: red cherries, &#8220;white&#8221; oatmeal, &#8220;black&#8221; chocolate chips, for the Hurricanes team colors, and pecans to make them Southern. The team had not long before moved here to NC from Hartford, CT. They didn&#8217;t win that year, but did in 2006. Probably can&#8217;t credit the cookies though.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve heard boiling the raisins before adding them to cookies are the way to go, don&#8217;t suppose anyone&#8217;s tried this? When I think about it, it sounds good (I haaate when raisins go all burnt and shrivelly) but I&#8217;ve not had a chance to give it a go yet&#8230;</p>

				<p>I love the Quaker recipe but I usually substitute chocolate chips for the raisins, change the light brown sugar to dark and add a wee bit of fresh nutmeg.  They are spicy and melty and rich.

				<p>though i am not really a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, they are my boyfriend&#8217;s favorites.  and now i&#8217;m definitely going to add raisinettes, since that&#8217;s his favorite candy.   i see that i&#8217;ll also have to make this recipe this weekend and surprise him.<br />
i was only planning to try out a new banana bread recipe (with mini chocolate chips and crunchy peanut butter).  maybe he&#8217;ll eat the cookies and leave the bread all to me.  hmmm, i think i&#8217;ve hatched a plan.  thanks, deb.</p>

				<p>I usually use dried cranberries in my oatmeal cookies rather than raisins, dunno if you&#8217;re into such things but I thought I&#8217;d share &#8211; it&#8217;s really pretty delicious, I think, and a nice dried-fruit diversion from raisins now and then. =)</p>

				<p>Oatmeal raisin cookies are my husband&#8217;s favorite &#8211; esp. the ones he remembers his grandmother making.  Every recipe I&#8217;ve tried isn&#8217;t quite right, but I&#8217;m getting closer.  I found one of Grandma&#8217;s secrets: putting the raisins through a grinder.  Not having a grinder, I tried the food processor &amp; it&#8217;s amazing how much better the cookies are with the raisins chopped up (and I&#8217;m already a raisin fan).  While this helped, he said it still isn&#8217;t right.  I&#8217;m going to give your recipe a try this weekend (but with the raisins chopped).</p>

				<p>I just finished making these delicious, heaven sent cookies. They were amazing! My husband at 4 of them in silence, and then uttered two words&#8230;.&#8221;Oh, my!&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him I was taking them for the people at work tomorrow, and he got visibly upset with me&#8230; I may have created an addict. </p>
<p>That said&#8230; I cooked them for about 8 minutes after chilling them. My oven cooks a little hotter than normal. At the eight minute marker they came out chewy just like I like them!</p>
<p>Thanks for the wonderful recipe. It is definitely a keeper. </p>

				<p>I hear you about baking cookies and sharing them with friends (in your comment on #39)!  It is totally a win/win situation :)  Except usually, I will be sitting there late at night after the cookies are gone thinking &#8220;why did I give those cookies away&#8221;???  These cookies look fab, will have to try soon . . .</p>

				<p>Wow, I just made this same 1/2 recipe last weekend.  Sometimes we get so wrapped up in chasing the best chocolate chip cookie recipe that the humble oatmeal cookie gets neglected..  For mine,  I used walnuts and dried sweetened cranberries, a little more vanilla, a dash of nutmeg, and another dash of dried ginger.  The dough smelled and tasted  fantastic and so were the baked cookies.  This is definitely a keeper.</p>

				<p>Deb you should try simmering your raisins in coffee for about 30mins before adding them to your recipe. It plumps the raisins right up and gives them the most amazing flavor!</p>

				<p>I make the original recipe all the time, but I use (more) dried cranberries instead of raisins. Next time I&#8217;ll only use brown sugar and see how I like that. I find that the original recipe produces a very think cookie and I like mine more full.</p>

I have already made your Irish car bomb cupcakes and the key lime cheesecake and shared them with the good folks I work with.  Their only complaint&#8230;that I didn&#8217;t make enough!

				<p>This is my first comment after finding your blog through Not Martha a while ago. I&#8217;ve been reading your archives every night and pretty much bookmarked almost every other recipe in a new folder in my favorites called &#8216;dinner&#8217;. :-) These cookies are chilling now. I&#8217;ll let everyone know how they turn out. I added a bit more cinnamon and only put half the raisins in half of them because my boyfriend doesn&#8217;t like &#8220;poor pathetic used to be grapes&#8221; as he calls them. Thank you so much!</p>

				<p>What great looking cookies, Deb!  I&#8217;m on the road for a couple of weeks without my sweetie, and I&#8217;ve been thinking about what I might bake for him to celebrate my return.  He&#8217;s a tough one in that he&#8217;s not all that fond of sweets, with one exception:  oatmeal cookies.  We both love my family&#8217;s recipe for thin, lacy oatmeal cookies, but I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for a recipe that produces plumper, chewier little rounds.  Your recipe looks like just the thing!  I can&#8217;t wait to try it.  Thanks so much, Deb, for helping to make my return home a little sweeter.</p>

				<p>I just made these, they are SUPER yummy and easy! I shaped the dough into small balls and put them in the fridge. I made a small batch of cookies and froze the remaining balls of dough for later. Now the real question is how am I going to resist eating all of them tonight. So glad I just a handful instead of the entire batch, also thanks for halving the recipe, I hate getting stuck with dozens of cookies to eat. Thank you! Loved this recipe.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m all for sweets and cookies populating ninety percent of this site! I also frequently wake up craving cookies and can&#8217;t trust myself with an entire batch, so contend with making just a few. I still fall back on the Smitten thick and shattery salt and white chocolate version (sans the chocolate) when the need strikes, as well as &#8216;healthier&#8217; own creations such as aniseed scones and orange flower water cookies. But this looks just too good to miss, especially as I still have kilos of oats in my larder ostensibly for the purpose of making porridge&#8230;</p>

				<p>Thank you for this!! My first/last attempt at making oatmeal cookies left me with the impression that they&#8217;re just not something I can bake myself.<br />
I just whipped these up, incredibly simple. I don&#8217;t like raisins, so I used Craisins instead and my boyfriend who likes neither oatmeal cookies nor Craisins went back for seconds. You&#8217;re wonderful!</p>

				<p>Thanks for posting this recipe &#8211; I love this blog!  This recipe is one of my favorites, too.  I like it with dried blueberries and apricots.  Have you ever tried mixing together the egg and vanilla, then soaking your raisins (Craisins, blueberries, apricots)  in it for an hour before you out the whole mix in the recipe?  The fruit plumps up, takes on the vanilla flavor, and the taste is amazing!</p>

				<p>My mouth is watering&#8230;I love oatmeal raisin cookies! And you and I seem to be on the same page about the texture&#8230;yum! I think these totally qualify as a breakfast food! There&#8217;s oats and raisins in them, that&#8217;s healthy, right?</p>

				<p>I was wondering about the scoop, freeze, and bake later part. I would love to have these in my freezer ready to bake when the craving strikes. So you scoop to cookies into rounds and then freeze them separately, I assume. After they are frozen, do you store them together in the freezer? Do they stick to each other? And how long do they keep this way?</p>
<p>These look so delicious!! Thank you!</p>

				<p>The process is called flash-freezing. You scoop, spread the scoops out on a tray and then freeze them. Once they&#8217;re cold enough not to stick together, you can put them in a freezer bag. But you have to keep the bag frozen from that point, or you&#8217;ll be back to one mound of cookie dough.</p>

				<p>I was reading The America&#8217;s Test Kitchen Family Cookbook the other day, and it said that the secret to really chewy cookies is melted butter, not softened.  What are your thoughts on that?  I noticed that someone else mentioned melted butter in one of the earlier comments.</p>

				<p>the vanishing oatmeal cookie recipe on the lid of quaker oats has been my favorite for my entire life, they are the most delicious! i was excited when i saw your suggestions for improvement because each time i bake the original recipe my cookies turn out exteremely flat. my husband and i still loved the taste but i always knew he was longing for thick and chewy- not thin and crispy! i made your version last night and they were much better!<br />
thank you!</p>

				<p>Christina &#8212; I&#8217;d disagree. I&#8217;d argue that the trick to <i>crispy</i> cookies is melted butter. Melted butter also makes better crisp toppings. But softened butter is able to be whipped and suspend ingredients in a lighter state and makes for cakier, more tender cookies. This is the reason cakes always have softened butter with the other ingredients slowly whipped in, too.  Soft cookies = softened butter. Crisp cookies = melted butter. But, they&#8217;re the ones who test this stuff out &#8212; if anyone wants to try this recipe both ways, I am sure others would love to hear the input.</p>
<p>Lauren &#8212; I use <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/smitten-20/detail/B0001598EI" rel="nofollow">a scoop</a>. I have a few different sizes, but probably use the one linked the most.</p>

				<p>I was pretty lazy in making these cookies&#8230; didn&#8217;t have a lot of brown sugar so I had to use some white, couldn&#8217;t be bothered waiting to chill them, etc etc, but they still turned out awesome! My flatmates are already begging for more, which I&#8217;ve promised as soon as I get more brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>I, too, have very specific requirements when it comes to my oatmeal raisin cookies.  Chewy and no chocolate.  Chocolate in oatmeal raisin cookies is sacriligious!  I am almost always disappointed in cookies that I get elsewhere.</p>
<p>I may try your recipe, but I am from the south and we do like our things sweet.</p>
<p>Also, no nuts &#8211; at all.</p>

				<p>Debbie &#8212; You&#8217;d be looking for something between one and two tablespoons. However, keep in mind that baking time may vary in your oven &#8212; it&#8217;s best to use doneness, and not the timer, to let you know when your cookies are baked.</p>

				<p>These are so good!  I made a batch this afternoon with some modifications, and they&#8217;re delicious!</p>
<p>I swapped 1/4 c. of the oats for 1/4 c. of wheat germ (at the suggestion of a commenter)<br />
I swapped raisins for some dried cherries (chopped) and swapped walnuts for chocolate chips</p>
<p>I have to say&#8211;even the half recipe made a ton of smallish cookies!  I used my scoop (1 1/2 tbsp-ish) and baked 9 cookies and then froze about 30 more!  Yay for tons of tasty cookies!  Thanks for another winner, Deb.</p>

				<p>yet again, you&#8217;ve posted a recipe about something i&#8217;ve been obsessing about recently&#8230; wish i had this recipe two batches of crunchy *the horror!* oatmeal cookies ago.  i do find that even the smallest amount of white sugar just messes things up!  unfortunately, i&#8217;ll have to wait til my mom comes back from overseas to make these since she is THE oatmeal cookie lover.</p>
<p>i agree with that melted butter thing&#8230;  makes crispier cookies (and kinda greasy..  maybe that&#8217;s just me&#8230;)</p>

				<p>OMG, Deb we would be great friends ;) I just came across your site last week and I am a woman obsessed. Like you, I frequently take over my tiny NYC kitchen and treat my coworkers to weekly treats. Tonight, I made the Indian Spiced Cauliflower and Potatoes ($20 at Fairway! But just because I had to buy all the spices) and I almost at the entire thing myself- SO GOOD. And now, I&#8217;m softening butter to try out these oatmeal raisin guys. I also (finally! yay!) got a KitchenAid standing mixer this week so I warned friends that armed with your recipes and a free weekend, they might be receiving baked goods care packages on Sunday. :) Thanks for the great blog and amazing pictures. I&#8217;m already an addict!</p>

				<p>I saw these on Thursday afternoon and made them Thursday night, and they are delicious.  The half recipe made just the right amount of cookies (I got thirty with a small scoop).  Thanks for the tip of scooping then chilling, I usually do the opposite.</p>

				<p>Did you see the NY Times article a few months ago where they figured out that chilling the dough is one of the secrets of a great cookie? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m imagining these with ginger and butterscotch instead of raisins. I imagine they&#8217;d be pretty fantastic.</p>

				<p>My teeth are always looking for chewy cookies to sink into&#8230; slightly visceral.  Anwyas, if this promises chewiness, I am sold.  I am unaware of the nuances to what makes a crispy v chewy cookie (although I have been trying to re&#8217;watch an alton brown show on the differences visavis chocolate chip cookies).</p>
<p>What clues or hints can I glean from recipes that will allow me to know when things are chewy or not?  Egg ratio? Butter v oi?</p>
<p>Id love toknow!</p>
<p>In any case, I will make these and enjoy the sinking bitesatisfaction I am on the hunt fore!</p>

				<p>I made these today after my &#8220;19-yr-old daughter, AKA student at Art Institute of Philly &#8212; post #140 above&#8221; told me that your blog was her new obsession.  I saw the cookies and had to have them.  The chilling did the trick, my friend.  They were delicious.  And my 10 year old even loved them, nuts and all, and normally she&#8217;d rather poke a chopstick in her eye than go near a nut.  Thanks&#8230; I plan to try more of your recipes.  I am also enjoying the photography!</p>

				<p>Hi Krista &#8212; Yes. We made <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/leites-connusmate-chocolate-chip-cookie/" rel="nofollow">those cookies</a> too!</p>
<p>Allie &#8212; I don&#8217;t personally recommend a full swap of whole wheat flour unless you&#8217;ve tested it in a recipe. In baked goods, I start with 1/3 to 1/2 swap, you can dial it up from there in future batches if you feel it can handle it, as WW does not bake the same way as AP and you may find it too coarse/brittle.</p>

				<p>Not sure what happened but I posted this on the wrong recipe a minute ago. You and me must be thinking on the same chewy oatmeal wavelength. I made these last night — absolutely perfect for my craving. I put in dried fruit instead of just raisins and made hazelnut ice cream sandwiches with them. The pairing is divine! Oh, and I, um, am eating more ice cream sandwiches for breakfast right now. :)</p>

				<p>YUM! These are going to be my go-to oatmeal raisin cookies from now on. We made them last night and they were perfect. For those folks who might have wheat intolerances, I ran out of regular white flour and used spelt flour instead (leftover from the cracker recipe on this site). They turned out just like in the photo.</p>

Not to mention, they were exactly what *I* was craving. (I saved quite a few for my own consumption.) In fact, I think it might be time for another, with some hot tea, very soon!</p>

				<p>Wonderful cookies for a Sunday afternoon. The refrigeration technique really worked to make these cookies nice and chewy. From all the comments it seems like a great basic recipe that can lead to all kinds of adaptations. I used golden raisins and added a 1/2 teaspoon of five spice powder for an extra kick. Thanks for the inspiration.</p>

				<p>Oatmeal raisin are my husband&#8217;s FAVORITE cookie. I informed him yesterday that he would be coming home to these today. A couple of minutes after he walked in the door I grabbed one and stuck it towards his mouth to take a bite. Which he did. And as he walked away I heard, ummm. Another couple of steps (and chews), ummmm. And another couple of steps and chews, uuummmmmmm.</p>
<p>Yeah. They are that good. I changed nothing following all directions step-by-step except for tripling the recipe.</p>
<p>I believe Quaker Oats needs to put your recipe on their box!</p>

				<p>These cookies are so awesome! I actually love the Quaker oats recipe, but I&#8217;ve been looking for a new one using rolled oats since we really don&#8217;t eat Quaker oats to have them in the house. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I made the cookies tiny, about an inch, so I could eat lots of them and not feel guilty. And, best of all, my husband, who despises oatmeal raisin cookies LOVES these! Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>I just made these last night and I am in LOVE. I may have overcooked them a bit since I thought when I tested them 15 mins in that they were too soft. I lightly pressed the tops and they would give too easy&#8230; maybe I should have pulled them out and let them cool which would have stiffed them up a little. </p>
<p>Regardless, they are amazing, I wonder how they taste with golden raisins!</p>

				<p>As I am easily swayed by power of suggestion, I immediately set out to make these cookies.  The texture is great-a little crisp and nice chewiness.  However, they were way too sweet for me.  What I did differently, though: I used dried sweetened cranberries instead of raisins and used brown sugar rather than light brown sugar.  Would following the original recipe have yielded less sweet cookies?  Is there a big difference between regular brown sugar and light brown sugar in terms of sweetness? Same with cranberries vs raisins?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve tried many oatmeal cookies in the past but I usually only eat one or two. The rest I give away. But with this recipe I actually ate more than two! I reduced the sugar a little bit and put the dough in the fridge. This is my first time trying a recipe from your blog. Thank you for sharing. Beautiful photos!</p>

				<p>THANK YOU!  made these last night, using a mix of cranberries, walnuts and choc chips and have brought them in to work as an after lunch surprise.  The only problem was that the batter was SO good and it was late so the chilling time got shortened as I wanted to eat one!  I just started subscribing to your blog thanks to my work buddies making your great carrot cake cupcakes for my birthday this month and can&#8217;t wait to try your other stuff.  Keep it coming!</p>

				<p>I love this recipe. Who knew that the trick to thick cookies was chilling them?!? Well, obviously you. That is why I love you (platonically of course). Oatmeal Raisin Chocolate Chip Cookies are a favorite of my Dad and I. He had a business trip out to the East Coast (from CA) and was able to stop by and visit me yesterday. I surprised him with these cookies and he LOVED them. This is my new go-to cookie recipe. Thanks!</p>

				<p>one of my NEW ALL-TIME FAVES&#8211;for ease &amp; taste!<br />
the workplace concurs, as they consumed almost 5 doz cookies today!</p>
<p>i agree re: salt&#8211;use 1/2 teaspoon &amp; i leave the walnuts out, though i&#8217;d be a fan of pecans or cashews.</p>
<p>try this variation:<br />
instead of raisins, 3/4 c cherry-flavored dried cranberries<br />
plus 3/4 c chopped heath bars</p>

				<p>These are the best cookies I have ever baked. I chopped the walnuts into tiny little pieces, almost like sand, and it&#8217;s perfect if you don&#8217;t like a big chunk of walnut in your cookie. Mine did not spread in the oven at all. I took them out after 10 minutes, pressed them gently with the back of a spoon to flatten, then baked for another 2 minutes.  This is a fantastic recipe!</p>

				<p>Hi Regan &#8212; I&#8217;ve never tried it, but I&#8217;d love to hear how it worked out. I can&#8217;t think of any reason that it wouldn&#8217;t &#8212; the only risk might be a tough cookie.</p>

				<p>cool, i&#8217;ll try it with both then, and let you know! i worked off of your peanut butter cookie recipe and they were fantastic. i baked a half batch w/all purpose, and half batch with bread flour and the bread flour wins it! the all purpose makes them flat and crunchy. the bread flour makes them fat and chewey! same with my chocolate chip cookies.<br />

				<p>Made these last night after drooling over them for days&#8230; they were everything you described and more.  We loved that they aren&#8217;t too sweet &#8211; I added a few chocolate chips (not that it needed it but I couldn&#8217;t resist) and we are devouring them.  Absolutely perfect &#8211; and love the hint of chilling the dough &#8211; I&#8217;ve always wondered how to get my cookies thicker.  Thanks!!!</p>

				<p>deb- I was the one asking about the way sweet taste using brown sugar rather than light brown sugar.  As per your suggestion, the half cup of brown sugar did the trick for me. Thanks!  Also, I followed a suggestion from a commenter who soaks the raisins (or cranberries in my case) in egg and butter for an hour before combining with other ingredients.  I think they did plump up more and gave the cranberries more pop.  Friends became instant fans of the cookies.  Wow, over 200 comments for an oatmeal raisin cookies post!</p>

				<p>YUM! I saw these pictures yesterday and immediately went to the store to get some raisins. After I made them I kept 4 balls in the fridge for a few hours and froze the rest. i love how thick they turn out, and i just ate the last one a few minutes ago. DELISH!<br />
although, have you ever soaked the raisins in the egg/vanilla for an hour prior to mixing it all in like some recipes do? my mom swears this makes &#8220;the best&#8221; oatmeal raisin cookies, although i&#8217;m not sure what that step does. softens the raisins maybe? i might try it next time! :)</p>

				<p>Ok&#8230;these cookies are THE cookies.  Perfect, round little spheres of chewy cookie, studded with ever impressive raisins&#8230;I made a double batch the other night with the intention of saving half and sending the other half with my husband to his office.  Well, after several taste tests, more than half of the cookies remained home with my husband and I and only a meager 1/4 of the cookies made it to the office&#8230;.they were just to good to share&#8230;..</p>

				<p>These turned out amazingly good!</p>
<p>Just a side note for the adventurous.  I always experiment in my cooking &amp; baking, and thought I&#8217;d add a touch of maple syrup to the dough.  Bad idea.  Even a little bit makes the cookies sticky &amp; crunchy.  Good thing I tried it on just a couple cookies first.</p>

				<p>These cookies are phenomenal!  I absolutely love the texture!  Not overly sweet themselves but could be enhanced by the addition of some white chocolate chips if you like a sweeter cookie.  I enjoyed them just as they are.  A lightly crisped bottom with a chewy, yet, not undercooked center.  Perfect.  My new favorite cookie.</p>

				<p>First I want to say thank you for this recipe. This was my second time making cookies in my whole life. The first time I made them was last week off the Quaker Oats Can, They came out horrible. So i did a little research and came across your recipe. I made them yesterday just like you said. They came out goooood. They are just like you said they would be. They were soft  and chewy. I used quick cooking rolling oats added a little nutmeg, walnuts and pecans along with the raisin<br />
 awesome is the word. Funny when I was a kid, I did not like oatmeal cookies at all. Now I can&#8217;t get enough of them. Again thank you so much.</p>

				<p>Came across your blog recently and I am enjoying it very much. Thanks. Your photos are beautiful with sassy comments and recipes clear and easy to follow. Inspired I made the Oatmeal cookies tonight. I didn&#8217;t have cinnamon so subed it with 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder. Also I didn&#8217;t have brown sugar so used 1/2 cup caster sugar. It was not that chewy maybe because I reduced sugar quantity. But the result was still very very good. I will make them again for sure. My next project is &#8220;Mom&#8217;s Apple Cake&#8221; which looks and sounds wonderful. Thanks for sharing all these wonderful recipes. From Jakarta</p>

				<p>I made these last night for the first time and substituted chocolate chips for the raisins.. :) They are great! Everyone loved them and they are so soft and chewy and wonderful. I made a full batch, but just baked a dozen of them. the rest are formed into  balls and frozen in the freezer &#8211; perfect for hot out of the oven cookies on short notice :)</p>

				<p>I like the sound of these cookies.  I love  cookies, especially oatmeal raisin cookies.  The problem is that I have developed a sensitivity to sugar and cannot have anything with a high sugar content.  I have substituted spenda in many recipies to varying degrees of success.  Do you think using the brown sugar splenda will work in this recipe?  If not, do you have any suggestions about making these cookies with some sort of sweetening substitute?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m really anxious to try these. My grandmother used to make chewy oatmeal cookies, sometimes kind of &#8220;cakey&#8221; in the center. Often she would use chopped dates instead of raisins, yum. All the recipes I&#8217;ve tried turn out crispy, ugh. </p>
<p>I live in the 4,500 ft alt range, wonder would there be any changes?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

				<p>Yes, recipes have to be adapted for high altitudes, but I live at sea level, and haven&#8217;t practiced it. If you have a Joy of Cooking, there are tips in there, or if you Google, I am sure there are resources and advice on the Web.</p>

				<p>I must tell you that since I started subscribing to your blog my cookies have greatly improved. My mom proclaimed that your oatmeal raisin cookies were great. I&#8217;ve tried several oatmeal recipes and all have failed. This recipe even though it is small was wonderful. The type of cookie everyone in my family loves. Chewy and soft and thick. Thanks for this cookie.</p>

				<p>I made these last night&#8230;they&#8217;re fabulous! The raisins I bought were a little larger than usual (they may have called them &#8220;jumbo&#8221; at my local health foods store&#8230;), and that made a huge difference. In my friend&#8217;s words, &#8220;it made the cookie!&#8221; Thanks!</p>

				<p>THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for this recipe!  I made a batch today and they are PERFECT &#8211; just what I have been craving for weeks :)  Hubby wanted chocolate chips instead of raisins so I split the batch after the oatmeal was mixed in and  stirred raisins in half and chocolate chips in the other half.  Interestingly, the cookies with choc. chips  flattened out more than the raisin ones&#8230; same pan, cooked at the same time &#8211; weird.  Both delicious though!</p>

				<p>Thank you!  These cookies are delicious.  I had made some tea for myself and decided that these cookies would go great with it.  I was able to make the cookies&#8211;start to finish&#8211;by the time my tea reach the perfect temperature for drinking (even with &#8220;help&#8221; from my five-year old).  I used whole wheat flour and quick oats, and not only are the kids loving them, but they even agreed to have them with the green tea, too. ; ]</p>

				<p>greetings from Scotland! I&#8217;ve always wondered how to get cookies chewy and now I know. I&#8217;m going to get my pinny on after work and make these as I&#8217;ve just eaten a store bought cookie that was not good enough. I love that so many folks here are so unashamed about baking for their man: you don&#8217;t need to be a Stepford wife to enjoy that and my hub is always so impressed and grateful.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
I made these cookies this weekend, but since I had no brown or cane sugar, I just had to make do with 1 TB molasses, added to a scant 2/3c of white sugar. The result was just amazing! Thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>I just wanted to say I made my oatmeal cookies with whole wheat flour and I think they are great.  Of course, I love the coarser taste of whole wheat, so there ya go.  I also added cinnamon and clove, softened the raisins, and added fiber . . . cause I love fiber.  :)<br />
Great recipe.  Thanks</p>

				<p>I used dates instead of raisins.  I added the lesser amount of salt.  I also refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes then took it out and rolled it into a log, placed it back in the refrigerator until I was ready for it.  When I took it out to bake, all I had to do was cut the dough in about 1 1/2 inch rounds (yeah they were thick.  I cut 11 total)  I then tried shaping them a little round on top to make sure the center would be chewy.  Hint:  you don&#8217;t have to shape them.  I found out after baking them that I had to press them in the middle or they would have been too thick to cook.  I had to bake them longer than 12 minutes.  I probably added about 6 to 7 minutes more.  Yeah!  That was a great heads up on cooking them until they were brown around the edges and looking a little uncooked in the center.  They came out perfect.  My daughter loved them!  I loved them!  Thanks a million.</p>

I left the dough in the fridge over night (because I started at 2 in the morning) and they were perfect the next morning.

They&#8217;re the best cookies I&#8217;ve ever had, and oatmeal raisin isn&#8217;t even my favorite. I think next time I&#8217;ll replace the raisins with chocolate chips!</p>

In bed the other night I was thinking..&#8221;hmmm, oatmeal cookies with dried blueberries and chocolate ships&#8221;&#8230;I used this as a base recipe. Excellent recipe. My hubby requested that I roll a few in coconut before baking..What a great idea! The coconut ones are baking now.<br />
Try the blueberry and choco combo..mm.mm.mm</p>

				<p>I made these adding a little mixed spice and chocolate chips, but otherwise following the recipe exactly. The flavor is very good but do not have what I would call a &#8216;chewy&#8217; texture &#8211; it&#8217;s more soft and cakey. Is this the effect that was intended or did I go wrong somewhere? I&#8217;m not so much a fan of the cakey texture so will be giving these out to friends!</p>
<p>I heard that one secret to chewy cookies is to use golden syrup (the closest US equivalent is corn syrup) in place of some of the sugar, so maybe I will try this next time. Anyone have any more ideas?</p>

				<p>This recipe is wonderful! I am baking these cookies as I type!  I used craisins instead of raisins, and the tart flavor definitely compliments the recipe.  Whoever hasn&#8217;t tried this recipe yet, I highly recommend it.  Very easy and very tasty!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these twice now, and not only are they amazing, they are easy too! I think I&#8217;m gonna memorize the recipe and use it as my go-to company cookie recipe. Everyone raves about them.</p>
<p>Also: try pre-cooking the raisins by submersing them in water and microwaving for a minute. It makes them super soft and makes the cookie just that much better.</p>

				<p>Yes, indeed these are delicious!  I&#8217;m sending them to my husband, who is out of town for awhile on business.  These are his favorite kind of cookie and I had hoped to make them for him before he left.  He is going to be so happy when he bites into one of these!  It made me happy too even though there was no chocolate in them.</p>

				<p>I found this site less than 24 hours ago and I am hooked.  Deb you do a great job.</p>
<p>I have searched high and low for a great ORC and though I have found some with great flavours they are often more tender and cake-like not so much &#8216;chewy&#8217;.  For me &#8216;chewy&#8217; has a slight stickiness to the bite.  I haven&#8217;t tried this recipe yet but I want to know from those who have made these cookies if they are cakey and if that is the intended texture.</p>

				<p>I sometimes substitute maple flavoring for the vanilla and also have used Crasins or other dried fruits like dates.  It&#8217;s all great as long as it&#8217;s with Oatmeal!  I love them for breakfast!</p>

				<p>I was craving oatmeal raisin cookies and when I googled the term, your site was one of the first 4. Boy, am I glad I decided to print your recipe! I just finished baking a batch and they were really really good!!! I went with the 1/2 tsp of salt and it was perfect. Next time I will try it with the craisins, as some have suggested. Thanks for such a wonderful blog!</p>

				<p>Thank you for providing an oatmeal cookie recipe that isn&#8217;t loaded with sugar.  Last weekend I made a batch of cookies that called for a cup of brown sugar AND a cup of white sugar.  Blech!  Too sweet!  These are the perfect sweetness and are delightfully chewy.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on!</p>

				<p>Thank you for the recipe.  These cookies are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!<br />
I baked them for the school open house last week, and they were gone in minutes while other cookie trays were still full.  People came back for seconds and thirds.  One woman even tucked one in her bag for later.<br />
I made them a little bigger (doubling the recipe to make about 30 cookies), so I flatten the dough a bit before baking &#8212; they really don&#8217;t spread out much while baking.  They came out thick and chewy as promised, and absolutely delicious!</p>

				<p>To no avail I have tried endlessly to make a thick and chewy oatmeal cookie worthy of gift giving. ALWAYS,they turned out flat and crispy.Finally one evening I typed in my search engine&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.  HELP,I need thick and chewy oatmeal cookies. and WAH-LAH&#8230;your site popped up&#8230;Needless to say the hint about refrigerating the dough for a bit was the one step my cookies needed. I have made several batches since and can&#8217;t thank you enough&#8230;But let me try.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU   ( ok, I think you get the point!!!)<br />
Taking them out just a tad before the timer goes off seems to be a good thing also..I actually ground some walnuts and put in one of my batches for the folks who don&#8217;t like the CRUCH of the nuts..( but they loved the flavor!!!!)</p>

				<p>These cookies tasted like they dropped out of oatmeal heaven.  I made them as a gift but was so tempted that I ate them and bought a gift. (Shame on me).  I always pre-soak my raisins in a cup of very hot water to bloat them before using them in a recipe.  This time, I heated some ginger brandy and let the raisins soak in it for approximately twenty minutes before adding them to the recipe.  The result was super delicious!!!</p>

				<p>One of the best cookie recepies ever.  I can never bake anything with sugar right but these cookies came out awesome.  I didnt have to search to find any of the recipies and the cookies taste better than store bought.  I replaced the raisins with dried cherries for a twist and the recipe was accepting of my change.  Thanks a bunch!</p>

				<p>i had a ridiculous PMS-induced oatmeal cookie craving and found your site via a google search. i should add that i don&#8217;t really know how to cook or bake but found this recipe to be quick, easy and very tasty. due to my cravings, i didn&#8217;t freeze the batter, but baked it right away. unfortunately, i have a gas oven at my apartment at school &#8212; which i&#8217;m still learning to use (by trial &amp; error) &#8212; so the cookies ended up with burnt bottoms. nonetheless, the rest of it is excellent. thanks!</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
I am giving this a try, I live in Denver, so need to modify for the altitude. It can be tricky, but I added about 1/8c of flour. I&#8217;ll let you know how they turn out. They are chilling in the fridge right now. I tried the original quaker recipe last week, but they were too flat and I wasn&#8217;t happy. Of course my husband isn&#8217;t picky and ate them all anyway. I was going to toss them out.</p>

				<p>So, first batch is out, I let them cool a bit&#8230;they are delicious! Just he right amount of chewy to crunchy. So the added 1/8 cup of flour seems to be good for the high altitude. I didn&#8217;t make any other adjustments. I might try a batch with raisinettes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe and have a wonderful Thanksgiving.</p>

				<p>Three batches out of the oven now and they are hands down the BEST Oatmeal Raisin cookies I have ever made!  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!  I didn&#8217;t make any changes, chilled the dough overnight, baking off at 350°F in my convection oven on parchment paper.  These tasty morsels could have come from my favorite bakery!  Ok&#8230;now to enjoy one with a glass of milk!</p>

				<p>OK&#8230;&#8230;.I have been having Oatmeal Cookie bad luck for years now, yet every now and then I get this craving for the perfect oatmeal cookie, just as you have described above.I would then proceed using different recipes and every time they&#8217;d turn out like flat, crispy flying saucers resulting in me saying &#8220;Never Again!&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..A few weeks ago my dear craving returned and I went online instead to find my dream recipe and stumbled on this one. FINALLY I have found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow!!!!!!!!They were exactly what I dreamed of and what you described above. I am now about to make batch No.2 and re-enter Oatmeal Heaven! Thank you!</p>

I added pecans instead of walnuts, and they are WAY yummy!!!  Due to my old oven, I had to bake for 8 mins so they wouldn&#8217;t be overdone!  Thanks for this recipe!!!</p>

				<p>Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my favorite, but whenever I made them in the past they came out crunchy &#8211; not how I like them. These cookies are perfect! I made them two days ago and they are still amazing. Plenty of raisins, a slightly salty/sweet taste (I used Kosher salt), moist, chewy and a little crunch with the nuts, what more could you ask for : )</p>

				<p>So, what seems to be the best amount of time, on average, that you need to chill the dough for? Recipe really didn&#8217;t go into specifics, and it seems to be an important step. I&#8217;m about to make &#8216;em&#8230;anyone found a reliable chill time that works? Thanks in advance!</p>

One thing we have done with cookie dough is lay it out on a piece of plastic wrap.  Form it into a log and then throw it in the freezer or fridge.  YOu can then cut off perfect shaped circles and throw it in the oven on a whim.<br />
Another way is to put it in a container in the freezer and scoop it out with an ice cream scoop when you are ready for a treat!  No need to flatten them out.</p>

				<p>These are the perfect proportion of chewy to crispy and the small size is good to keep my sugar cravings in line&#8230;. because I can eat the whole pan.  These are being packed as we speak and are joining my mother&#8217;s pizelle cookies for holiday care packages.  Thank you for sharing!!</p>

				<p>This is my all time favorite cookie too! Although I love it sweet I don&#8217;t know about cutting the sugar down. Since you like salt I have a suggestion I call it my little secret, but from the looks of all the comments you have here it won&#8217;t be for long. ha ha.. I tried this one year and have been doing it every since, because I LOVE it! Try adding Kosher Salt instead of normal ole salt. It really makes a world of difference.  I always bake at the holidays LOTS I give out lots of goodies and my ex-mother-in-law still gets her favorite every year My Oatmeal cookies.  She and many others noticed the difference with the change of salt, and like me loved it even more then before.  I hope you&#8217;ll give it a try and like it too. :) MERRY CHRISTMAS! :)</p>

				<p>Delicious! I made a few changes, including using craisins instead of raisins, cutting the cinnamon in half, doubling the salt and using shredded coconut instead of walnuts. The texture was great, and you are absolutely right, chilling the dough is an important step if you want them thick. Thanks!</p>

				<p>The Quaker recipe has been my family&#8217;s standard oatmeal cookie recipe my whole life, but your adaptations make them even better. I&#8217;ve had good luck replacing half of the all-purpose flour with white whole wheat in just about all baked goods. I use a little than half WWW in bread to maintain a good crust.</p>

				<p>I have a MAJOR problem with this recipe:<br />
It&#8217;s not big enough! =P</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;ve got a batch chilling in the fridge, and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;It&#8217;s not enough&#8230;&#8221; I think last time I double it, but today all my butter was frozen.</p>
<p>I LOVE the all-brown-sugar touch. I&#8217;m a sucker for oatmeal raisin, and my husband once tried to bake some for me. Yuck-o-rama. I think the recipe was almost all white-sugar, with a touch of brown.</p>
<p>These have a wonderfully rich flavor, &#8220;burn&#8221; nicely at the edges while staying gooey in the middle. Oatmeal heaven!</p>

				<p>I loved this recipe! I altered it a bit because of my cravings and ended up with something awesome. Instead of raisins and walnuts I used dried cranberries and slivered almonds, and put in almond extract as well as vanilla. I also used 1/4 cup of applesauce and half the butter to cut down on fat, and took them out a little early to make them chewier.</p>
<p>They turned out AMAZING! Thanks!</p>

				<p>I was in the mood for some oatmeal cookies and found this recipe.  And boy am I glad I did! These cookies are perfect!  After reading some of the previous comments, I may try craisins and pecans next time.  There will definitely be a next time. I&#8217;m a bit afraid of tampering with perfection though. Thanks for the recipe.  I looked around the site and found so many more things I want to try.</p>

				<p>these turned out perfect!!! oh my, so good!  i had dried cranberries and oats leftover from your granola bar recipe, so decided to make these. also added walnuts.  didn&#8217;t have enough butter, but just put a bit of olive oil. i should have added wheat germ too, next time. chilling them really makes a difference.  and i love the idea of freezing some for later.  genius.</p>

				<p>Great recipe that makes a perfect amount of cookie dough. I like to add a couple tablespoons of molasses and cut out an equal amount of brown sugar. For those who like a more cake like cookie, add a couple tablespoons of milk, it gives the cookie a softer crumb. It is a small change that makes a surprising difference.</p>

				<p>First time visiting your site!  I googled thick, chewy oatmeal cookies and your recipe was one of the first ones to pop up.  The first batch is in the oven and I am sure they&#8217;ll turn out great!  Last week I was listened to old podcasts of The Splendid Table and the host, Lynn, made mention to some common mistakes when baking.  Creaming butter into sugar was one of them.  I&#8217;ve always thought I knew what I was doing but she said that it takes upwards of 8 minutes to get all the air whipped into the butter for higher cookies and muffins.  I was no where near the 8 min mark.  But I tried it with these cookies and so far so good!  Now I am off to see what else is on this blog of yours.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been snowed in for about five days now and I wanted some Oatmeal Raisin cookies in the worst way! I love a chewy cookie and this was exactly that, crisp around the edge and chewy on the inside. The only thing I would change is to cut the salt in half, I don&#8217;t usually salt my food and this amount was overwhelming to me.<br />
Thanks for the recipe, it&#8217;s on my fridge. :-)</p>

				<p>I love to use yellow raisins, they are moister and plumper then black raisins and they taste and look better too. Anytime a recipe calls for raisins I always use the yellow raisins, they just taste better and seem to hold up through baking much better without getting all dried out.</p>

				<p>WOW these are awesome!  Great flavor and texture &#8211; good call on baking cold dough.  I might back off on the salt a bit next time but otherwise they&#8217;re perfect! I made these for my boyfriend for Valentine&#8217;s Day as oatmeal raisin is his favorite&#8230;and my last attempted recipe came out terribly&#8230;thin and crumbly.  I taste tested these (about 4 or 5 of them&#8230;just to be sure they were OK) and I&#8217;m confident he&#8217;ll love them as much as I did.  :-)</p>

				<p>I had a sudden craving for oatmeal cookies and was a little overwhelmed by the selection Google offered, especially since I&#8217;m particular about the texture, too. So, when I saw that yours specifically promised chewy, I knew it was for me ;-). They&#8217;re absolutely delicious&#8211;just took the first batch from the oven about 20 minutes ago. I thought it was funny that it&#8217;s almost a year to the day from when you posted the recipe&#8211;I suppose it&#8217;s something about cold wintry weather that makes a batch of homemade oatmeal cookies sound cozily delicious. Thank you!</p>

				<p>I made a variation of these last night.  These are the changes I made:  reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup and replaced half of that with agave nectar, used half whole wheat flour, and instead of raisins I split the dough into 3 groups and added 1/2 cup dried cherries to one, 1/4 cup dried apricots to another, and 1/8 cup dried cranberries, 1/8 cup shredded coconut to another.  Awesome!!</p>

				<p>Thank you for this amazing recipe.  I just discovered your blog in my search for an outrageous oatmeal cookie recipe.  I appreciate your &#8220;cooks&#8217; illustrated&#8221; approach of taking what you like and working on it to make it perfect.  You succeeded with these!!!!  I made a full recipe yesterday and they are perfect.  My modifications: subst half the AP flour for WW, half the raisins for cranberries, and used broken pecans instead of walnuts.  (I love the idea of using cherries in the previous comment, btw!)  I baked a dozen and frozen 2 dozen balls of dough for next time.  They are PERFECT, as you have described.  Delicately crispy on the outside and delightful and chewy (but not &#8220;underbaked&#8221; chewy) on the interior!!!  Outstanding.  Probably the best cookies of any kind that I have ever made!  Thank you!</p>

Nothing better than a good, chewy cookie&#8230;I think the cinnamon gives this recipe just the right kick. Plus, we tried chilling the mix and I think that added to the general texture and chewiness. Thanks for posting this.</p>

				<p>I made these into mini-cookies, (which means you can eat twice as many!) and added the end of a bag of chocolate chips.  Very good!  They don&#8217;t taste too oily or gummy like some oatmeal-raisin cookies.  A great recipe!  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Thank you for sharing your uplifting story and this wonderful recipe!   It inspired me to get into the kitchen and create a batch of oatmeal cookies!  Unforunately&#8230;I thought I had rolled oats, but in fact had steel cut oats. In the midst of making the dough, I had to find a substitute so I used Deluxe Muesli (with oat flakes, sultanas, malted wheat, wheat flakes, barley flakes, raisins, dates, currants, toasted coconut, sunflower seeds, banana, almonds, hazels, and cardamon).    The addition of the Muesli brought the taste and texture of the cookies to another level!   Thanks again for sharing and keep on baking!</p>

				<p>WOW. These were AWESOME!!!<br />
I followed the directions 100% except the last 1/3 cup of brown sugar I ran out and only had about a half of that, so I topped it off with white sugar. Came out AMAZING. I have been looking for a better oatmeal raisin cookie recipe.<br />
I think next time I will use WW flour.</p>

				<p>These are SERIOUSLY the BEST cookies I have made.  I have been looking for a thicker oatmeal cookie recipe forever and I am so thankful that you shared this one.  I made them with chocolate chips and no nuts. My hubby hates nuts in cookies and I didn&#8217;t have any raisins.  So good.  I can&#8217;t wait to make them again with raisins and nuts this time.  Thanks again!</p>

				<p>For those asking about using whole wheat flour, I just made a batch using half whole wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose flour and they are really good!  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d increase the ratio of whole wheat to AP, though.</p>
<p>I also added the zest of a large orange because I used cranberries instead of raisins.</p>

				<p>delicious, my sons and I made them, one of my sons does not like raisins though so we made half the batch with raisins and half the batch with semi sweet chocolate chips and they were delicious but not as good as the raisin half. oh and whole wheat flower in them is good, it&#8217;s the only kind i use.</p>

				<p>I ate something like this the other night but they featured dried cranberries, walnuts and chocolate chips. They were to die for.<br />
You can say all you want about chocolate chip cookies, but NOTHING beats, oatmeal (made with rolled oats not quick cooking variety) with chocolate chips and walnuts.<br />
And speaking of cc, I stopped by Bob&#8217;s Red Mill store, I live near THE outlet, and bought the most amazing semi sweet chocolate chips that I have ever tasted.<br />
They make Hershey&#8217;s and Toll House pathetic in comparison.<br />
They are so good, you could eat them like you would good quality chocolate.<br />
I MUST use their organic rolled oats, walnuts, and those chocolate chips to make a batch of oatmeal cookies.</p>

				<p>Well, I&#8217;m going to try these out on a large church group (300)  and I will double the recipe. I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes.  I always make the cookies on the lid of the Quaker Oatmeal box, and they&#8217;re just too brittle for me.  These look very promising.  It&#8217;s a send-off celebration for several people including a Chaplin who is off to Afghanistan.</p>

				<p>I love reading your recipes and comments.  I see everyone else has loved the oatmeal raisen cookies.  I was so taken with the recipe I decided to make it tonight and because I tend to guess at ingredient amounts, I put every single item in a little bowl and added as instructed.  The cookies were the very worst cookies I had ever made.  They are dry, tough and spread all thin on the cookie sheets.<br />
What in the world could I have done wrong?  I re read the recipe, then and again now and cannot see any flaw. I did increase the salt a bit but I measured everything.  My oven has been tested many times.   Wait.  I melted a bit of the butter  while forcing the softening but only a few tablespoons or so.  Could that have made a difference?  I am perplexed.</p>

I was wondering if you know anything about substituting bananas or something else for the butter, just to make them a little healthier&#8230;but I&#8217;ve never done a substitution like that before so I don&#8217;t know the replacement ratio. Any ideas? Thanks!</p>

				<p>You know, these should come with a disclaimer.  They are literally IMPOSSIBLE to stop eating.</p>
<p>I left out the cinnamon and subbed in 1c of craisins instead of raisins, and I used dark brown sugar.  I&#8217;ve never been a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies at all, but these cookies are freaking incredible, especially when warm, gooey, and straight from the oven.</p>
<p>Gianna (commenter above) apparently did something very, very wrong.  Thick, chewy, moist, and so delicious it&#8217;s ridiculous.  Chilling the dough is KEY!</p>

				<p>I must say, after reading all of these reviews I was very excited to try these cookies&#8230;and I am disappointed.  Perhaps I did something wrong- the only thing I changed was the size of the cookies. They a a lot cakey-er than I expected and not very sweet.  Any suggestions?</p>

				<p>Great looking recipe trying it out now&#8230;</p>
<p>Used some brown rice flour (replacing part of the all purpose flour) and combined some precooked organic steel cut groats with 1 cup of raw organic steel cut oats. </p>
<p>Also separated the doubled recipe into three batches:</p>
<p>=&gt;&gt; one with walnuts and choc chips<br />
=&gt;&gt; one with walnuts and raisins<br />
=&gt;&gt; one with walnuts &#8211; no choc chips or raisins</p>
<p>Let you know how it came out&#8230;</p>

				<p>I just made these last week. I&#8217;ve never made oatmeal raisin cookies before, but I had a co-worker ask me to make them for him. Everyone at work has been RAVING about them. I actually got asked to make them again this week. I also read somewhere that you should soak the raisins in hot tap water for 15 minutes so it doesn&#8217;t take the moisture from the batter. It definitely seemed to work. Thanks for the recipe! It really was awesome</p>

				<p>I was searching for several different variations of cookies on an oatmeal theme and came across this recipe.  Oh my, it sounds like the most fabulous oatmeal concoction!  I do agree with at least one poster above&#8230;never hurts to add extra raisins.  I defnitely will make these either tonight or tomorrow morning.  A recipe that&#8217;s been around this long on an internet forum and is still being commented on currently bears trying! :)</p>

				<p>I just took the last batch of these out of the oven. I made them as a treat for my girlfriend and I over the weekend and they are amazing! :) We just recently moved into a &#8220;House-Apartment&#8221; and I had to borrow some vanilla extract from the family downstairs, but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind when they got a bag of cookies!</p>
<p>Anyways, a little nutmeg in the batch as well as some sprinkled sugar while they&#8217;re still hot were my small adaptions.<br />
Thank you for this awesome recipe! I final have a blog I feel comfortable subscribing to for my cooking fancies.</p>

				<p>I told my DH that I would bake up some chewy oatmeal cooikies, after he baked up some flat, boring oatmeal cookies last week.  They just weren&#8217;t what I expected an oatmeal cookie to taste like. YOUR cookie recipe, however, was just what the doctor ordered! They&#8217;re chewy and chunky and just plain delicious! Just what I was looking for! I baked them last night and they&#8217;re almost gone! &#8211; DH had 5 and I had 4! :) I think I&#8217;ll have to double the recipe next time.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!</p>

				<p>Greetings from Singapore! Am into baking recently, and wanted to try my favorite oatmeal raisin cookies! After looking thru some i found online, decided to try out using your recipe! Simple, easy to follow.. and of course, the results were good! But i find the cookies on the soft side though.. How do i make it more crispier or harder? Am going to have another go at it this weekend!</p>

				<p>I bought a pizza stone yesterday (tried your fabulous pizza crust) and want to make these cookies as a gift this week, so I am wondering if you bake cookies on your stone?  Currently, the lentils and squash are cooking for your recent spicy squash lentil salad.  As you can see&#8230;..I&#8217;m a big fan.  I just have not raved as you certainly deserve, because my goodness- you get 450 posts just about cookies! Thanks Deb. xoxo</p>

				<p>Lindsay &#8212; I never have baked cookies on my stone. It might give them more browning/crust than needed but it&#8217;s hard to say. Absolutely worth trying and seeing how it works out for you. Would love to hear how it goes.</p>

				<p>Ok Deb (or her followers) maybe you can solve this puzzle.  I just baked the cookies on parchment on my stone and I think that was okay for them.  My really, truly, amazingly baffling puzzle is why whenever I make any cookie they always come out flat and thin.  I so wanted the thickness of these and thought it&#8217;d be the one.  Nope.  They look okay in the oven, but when I take them out they immediately deflate.  This happens always.  I&#8217;ve tried everything: new baking soda, chilling dough, softened butter vs. chilled butter, etc. I&#8217;m about to swear off baking cookies for the rest of my life! Thanks :) Lindsay</p>

				<p>You say that you cut back on the sugar from the Quaker Oats recipe?  If you double your recipe to make it even with the Quaker Oats,  You get one and one third cups of sugar.  The recipe on the Quaker Oats box only uses one and one fourth cups. Your recipe uses more sugar than the Quaker Oats recipe.   Just Saying!</p>

				<p>I hopped on here and just made these! I used golden raisins and dried cranberries in place of the raisins &#8211; perfection!!! I even tried making a lower fat version with a butter substitute (I Can&#8217;t Believe It&#8217;s Not Butter &#8211; Fat Free Spread) and they were delightful! They remained thick and chewy and didn&#8217;t spread out across the cookie sheet. Delicious!!!</p>

				<p>I have never in my life made a cookie that was successful. I don&#8217;t know why &#8211; I follow a recipe exactly as someone gives it to me, and my cookies are always inedible.  Well.  I made yours!  The first batch was ruined because they got overcooked (not by me, for once). I tried again &#8211; I cooked at 350 in a convection toaster oven for 8 mins and perfection!!  I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins, and they are fabulous. Thank you so much &#8211; I love your website!</p>

				<p>These are amazing&#8230;seriously the best oatmeal cookies I&#8217;ve ever had. I knew how good they&#8217;d be right when I tried the batter :) And the half recipe makes a perfect amount, it&#8217;s much too dangerous for me to make more than a couple dozen cookies at a time! Deb, your website is fantastic and everything I&#8217;ve made has turned out great. Keep up the good work!</p>

				<p>I have always done the same thing (just did it 10 minutes ago) but my little trick is to make a full batch, and just prior to adding the raisins I divide the dough and make half raisin and the other half chocolate chip.</p>
<p>Then I bake up one cookie sheet of each and scoop the remaining dough onto a wax paper covered cookie sheet.  I put the &#8220;extra&#8221; into the freezer until they are frozen then I put them into a vacuum bag.  Saves me time next time I need a fix.</p>

				<p>Hi! I&#8217;m new to your site. I&#8217;ve been looking all over the Net for a good recipe of chewy oatmeal raisin cookies. Coz I&#8217;m gonna bake some for the first time today. I&#8217;ve always loved nice, chewy oatmeal raisin cookies. Back in Philippines, there is one bakeshop that has really, really good ones, but for some reason, I couldn&#8217;t find any chewy ones here in Singapore (or, perhaps, I didn&#8217;t look enough). So, I&#8217;m going to make some today with my 2-year-old daughter. And I&#8217;m gonna use your recipe. The amazing pictures you got of them simply won me over. :)</p>

				<p>Thank you for allowing me the privilege of shocking my female friends and family when I make these. I use your recipe with sliced almonds instead of walnuts and I use old fashioned oats instead of the smaller oats. So far, I&#8217;ve gotten comments like, &#8220;These are the best cookies I&#8217;ve ever had!&#8221; and &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you made these! They are so good!!!&#8221; Just a side note, I love to cook but as a 34 year old former football player, it&#8217;s a little surprising to friends that see me bringing out a batch of these bad boys and hearing them go on and on about how great they are. Thank you and great recipe!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m in the process of making these right now.  Just took out the first batch and tasted one. Perfect!  I used a melon baller and didn&#8217;t fill the scooper.  Dropped dough about the size between a quarter and half dollar. Cookies are two inches in diameter.  Wonderful.  Love it.  I love cinnamon so was more liberal.</p>

				<p>While I have another batch of these wonderful cookies in the oven, thought I&#8217;d add my two cents worth.<br />
These are the easiest, softest cookies I have ever had.  Even my picky cookie eater friend asked when I was making more.  Made double batch last week and they were gone in a day!  Only thing I did was omit the nuts and added a little more of the raisins.<br />
Thanks for a great recipe.</p>

				<p>We just made these cookies for Santa. They were very delicious and we had to hold back from eating them all. Even our 2 year old said, &#8220;Santa doesn&#8217;t need cookies. Let&#8217;s eat them.&#8221; One question for you&#8230;they did turn out flat and I&#8217;m wondering if the Seattly rain and humidity might be the cause. Any thoughts on counteracting this, if this is the culprit? </p>
<p>P.S. I love your blog. My favorite dessert post is the Chocolate Stout Cake. I like to serve it with Deborah Madison&#8217;s Warm Cherry Sauce (using black cherries) and homemade whipped cream. Ahhhhhh.</p>

				<p>Just made these and they&#8217;re disappearing really quickly!  Since we didn&#8217;t have brown sugar, nor molasses, I started mixing up your recommended one cup white sugar with 1.5 tbsp maple syrup I had on in.  Since maple syrup didn&#8217;t really darken the colour that much, I ended up blending 2.5 tbsp maple syrup.  Not only did this new concoction smell awesome, it fluffed up two about two cups adulterated sugar, of which I used two thirds cup per the recipe.  It baked up more than perfectly post-fridge-chilling for 12 minutes in my oven.  Since we&#8217;re actually pacing out the holiday over-eating half of the batch is being flash frozen in scoops to be baked at a later date&#8230; likely tomorrow morning for a *cough* &#8220;healthy&#8221; *cough* breakfast.  Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>I tried these because they sounded soooo good!  I added a little mace (because I was out of nutmeg) and some dried orange peel.  These are WONDERFUL cookies!  I can&#8217;t believe it, but they are actually better the day after (packaged air-tight, of course)!  Thank you so much!  They are thick, chewy, and even better than I thought!</p>

				<p>THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE! My sister and I were in a baking mood since we were snowed in here in NYC, and were craving oatmeal raisin cookies. I can&#8217;t have regular flour, so we did 1/2c  whole wheat flour and 1/4c regular all purpose flour. Also, cause I can&#8217;t have a lot of sugar, we used a splenda brown sugar blend instead of sugar/brown sugar. We used the suggestion to soak the raisins in water for a bit (used golden raisins) and it was such a good idea! We also used smart balance margarine instead of butter or oil. These turned out soooo good and so very very filling. We didn&#8217;t need dinner after we made these delicious chewy morsels last night. THANKS AGAIN!!!</p>

				<p>I just made these and they&#8217;re awesome! I panicked when I noticed that I was out of vanilla extract &#8211; but thought I&#8217;d try my luck with almond, instead. It worked great. They&#8217;re just like I like my oatmeal cookies- slightly crunchy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside. Thanks!<br />

				<p>You can butter the baking sheet, but you do risk the cookies spreading more. Not always a terrible thing, some people prefer them thinner than shown.</p>

				<p>Oh my goodness, these cookies are 100% delicious!  I am impatient&#8230;  :D  so I didn&#8217;t freeze them, but baked them right away.  They were awesome!  I doubled the recipe b/c I have 3 boys with bottomless pits for stomachs, and it was a huge hit!  I was a tad disappointed b/c I am counting calories to lose some weight and these cookies came out to about 95 calories each.  However, most delicious things are&#8230;  *shrugs*  I will see if I can cut out some of the calories without losing their greatness.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!</p>

				<p>these were perfection! i overcooked them slightly, so they were a tad crispier on the bottom than intended, but that was just my mistake. the dough was incredibly easy to prepare &amp; i had most of the ingredients in my cabinet already. they were gooey in the middle, chewy, thick, &amp; had a delicious, addictive flavor! i did put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes before baking and i feel like it definitely made a difference. thank you for the recipe! i&#8217;ll be using this again &amp; again.</p>

				<p>These were great! Fantastic combination of sugar, flour, and butter. Makes a great batter. Also love your chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, which we added butterscotch chips, raisins, coconut, and walnuts..we called them &#8220;monster&#8221; cookies : )</p>

				<p>I was looking for an incredible oatmeal cookie recipe but I will admit that I have been disappointed in the past when finding recipes online that claimed to be one thing but had the turn out of something else.  When I read that this baker was very picky about her cookies, I felt that this could be the recipe I was looking for.  I followed the directions to a T and these are the BEST cookies I have ever made.  They are exactly what they are claimed to be.  They are thick, chewy and absolutely have an ADDICTIVE flavor you almost can&#8217;t get enough of.  I recommend this recipe to anyone who is looking for a great oatmeal cookie recipe.  I made them with dried cranberries in the first batch and raisins in the second and both were fantastic.  I didn&#8217;t use nuts, but that is just a preference.  I strongly recommend and hope you enjoy these as much as I did!  This is now my forever recipe when it comes to oatmeal cookies!  Thank you so much for sharing it!</p>

				<p>Someone special to me requested &#8220;chewy&#8221; oatmeal cookies and I&#8217;m so glad I found/tried your recipe first!  It will be my go-to from now on!  I baked them for Christmas and again for their birthday.  They said these cookies would &#8220;make you forget a gunshot wound!&#8221; I took a few to work and my boss said he thought they were &#8220;professionally made&#8221; from a gourmet bakery in one of our posh shopping districts!  My only addition was butterscotch chips to make them into &#8220;Oatmeal Scotchies.&#8221;  I found the first batch too sweet, so I cut back on the chips the next time.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!</p>

				<p>Oatmeal raisin is my favorite cookie!  I made these last night with walnuts, and I am so impressed. It had the perfect texture. I put the first pan in without cooling because I was anxioius to try one.  I put the second pan in after cooling the batter in the refrigerator.  I could tell the difference. This recipe will forever be THE OATMEAL RAISIN recipe that I will use! I do wonder, however if anyone knows the substitution for all purpose white flour for a wheat blend flour? I am trying to eliminate bleached foods from my diet. Thank you.</p>

				<p>Can we say AWE-SOME!!!  Delicious!!  I&#8217;m not usually a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, I love my chocolate chip! lol!  However&#8230;.I just think I might could take this over the chocolate chip if it was an option!  So much better than ANY I&#8217;ve had before!  Soft, chewy, not hard or crunchy!  Absolutely amazing!  Thanks!  I have some extra batter from tonight that I plan on having tomorrow after dinner.  That time can&#8217;t come soon enough! lol! ;)</p>

				<p>Awesome cookies!  This will be the recipe my family uses from now on.  I made this recipe exactly as written on Monday, and today I will be making a double batch to share with friends.  My husband said they were the best cookies he&#8217;s ever had.  As far as cookies go, the oatmeal and raisins make these a healthy treat!  I would totally eat these for breakfast.</p>

				<p>Interesting recipe. I clicked on it while looking for a recipe for dry, crunchy cookies. There was a time, I think, when cookies were meant to be anything but chewy. And then the corporations began to advertise chewy cookies, just like when Mom pulled them hot from the oven. I want mine to be like Mom&#8217;s, so forgive me, but this old lady will keep on looking. Maybe later.</p>

				<p>Just made these minus the walnuts and only 1/2 cup raisins, used whole grain flour, didn&#8217;t chill dough in frig and WOW! I really like the lower sugar content, they are plenty sweet especially with the raisins, didn&#8217;t have parchment paper just put on a regular old baking sheet. Came out fluffy and not too chewy with the bottoms browned. Thanks for filling the crave!</p>

				<p>Absolutely awesome!  Since I don&#8217;t eat butter or dairy products in general, besides organic eggs, I substituted the butter with Earth Balance (it&#8217;s basically an olive oil based margarine).  The true test will be my husband who is outside shoveling AGAIN &#8211; we live in the Northeast.  Oatmeal Raisins are his favorite. </p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t wait&#8230;the cookies were fantastic!  Our daughter doesn&#8217;t like raisins so she asked me to put some dough aside and she added semi sweet chocolate chips. The ten year old got a hold of them first and replied, &#8220;these are really, really good, and they have oatmeal in them?&#8221;  The fifteen-year-old reponse, &#8220;they&#8217;re good!&#8221; So, two thumbs up from the kids! My husband&#8217;s response, &#8220;I had ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>p.s. (I also substitute white whole wheat flour and my family has no idea. Hee&#8230;hee..hee&#8230;)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve made these before, but it&#8217;s probably been awhile.  Decided to make them yesterday, but then realized I was out of vanilla.  Was wondering if it would be okay to leave it out, when I realized I had, what might be, a suitable substitute&#8230;..Green Apple Smirnoff.  I happened to have a mini bottle on hand.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever use the vanilla again.  I used 1 tsp. (for the half batch), but would probably use 1 1/2 tsp. next time for even more flavor.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve gotta try it!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been on a diet for the last 24 days, and I discovered your blog on day two. I&#8217;ve read and reread probably 100 of your incredible recipes each day, and eating/cooking vicariously through you has been such a pleasure. I&#8217;m crazy about everything!  Today,  I caved, and I made these.  Heaven. Utterly incredible.  I didn&#8217;t make a single change to the recipe because diet baked goods are sad. Using a 1 tbs scoopthingy, I got 32 intoxicating, blissful little morsels out of the deal, at 75 calories a pop.  Thank you so much for sharing your smashing recipes.</p>

				<p>I was searching for an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie recipe to bake for my husband &amp; came across this one.  They looked sooo yummy in the pictures &amp; had such great reviews from everyone, so I decided to go ahead and try to make them tonight (11:30). BUT&#8230;&#8230;.mine didn&#8217;t turn out good at all  =(   It looks like they completely melted&#8230;they arent crispy but they a flat &amp; as big around as pancakes, not edible at all!!  I followed the recipe exactly but here are a few things I wonder may have been the problem:  I used nonstick foil instead of parchment paper, I only let them chill in the freezer for about 10 minutes, &amp; I think I&#8217;ve had that baking soda for a good while now.  Would any of those things cause that???? The picture looks so awesome, I&#8217;d love to be able to make my husband something that looked like that!!</p>

				<p>Made these twice this week and boy were they a hit with everyone who tried them!  I had to soak my raisins in hot water for five minutes, and chilling the dough in the fridge definitely helped the cookies to turn out thicker.  In my experimentation I discovered that I needed to cook the cookies for 11 minutes.  Love these!  I will try the whole wheat flour next time.</p>

				<p>this is the 2nd time i made these doubling the recipe, and i&#8217;ve always combined your recipe with the one adapted from Flour by Joanne Chang:  <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2010/10/oatmeal-raisin-cookies-recipe-flour/" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2010/10/oatmeal-raisin-cookies-recipe-flour/</a></p>
<p>and the cookies are amazing!</p>
<p>i like yours because it has more oatmeal, and i like hers because it has the nutmeg &amp; the added steps to baking the cookies such as fluffing the butter &amp; sugar, flattening it before baking, rotating and tapping it down with a spatula midway through cooking.</p>
<p>i think the 2 combined=perfect cookie!</p>

				<p>Well I let them sit in the freezer over night &amp; cooked them on parcment paper. They turned out the same  =(  The only other thing would have been the baking soda. They just looked like I hadn&#8217;t put any flour in them at all. I&#8217;m so dissapointed&#8230;I usually do really good with baking desserts. Guess I&#8217;ll try again.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m sure you have heard this quite a bit but I honestly dont like oatmeal raisin cookies but my boss requested that I make them and I had to listen. Anyway, these are delicious&#8230;i added the 1/2 tsp of salt like you suggested and i think it probably makes the difference since I like my baked goods to have that hint of salt. I think i might try white chocolate chips and lessen the amt of white sugar next time.  Thanks :)</p>

				<p>I have been making these every couple of weeks and freezing the balls of dough so I can bake a couple here and there for my kids. They are perfect! I have done several variations, including white chocolate/cranberry/walnut, blueberry/dark chocolate and apricot/pecan. They have all turned out awesome. What a great, adaptable recipe!</p>

I want to make him oatmeal raisin cookies because smitty likes to eat, and the first site I googled was Smitten Kitchen!!!! I cannot wait to make these, even though im better at cooking dinner than baking. But its sooooo worth a try!!!</p>

				<p>Major fail on my part! I used Whole Wheat Flour, they came out really really dry.  Also my brown sugar was old/rock solid, tried softening it, so probably had less than required. Ugh! Lesson learned, baking is exact, can&#8217;t substitute too much. Well, I was able to ball up a few to freeze.  The rest went into a container, I&#8217;ll bake it and have it as a topping for vanilla ice cream.  I made these cookies last year and they were so good, so i know how great they are!</p>

				<p>Thanks- these were great, I&#8217;m the only one who likes raisins around here (at least in cookies) so we used c.c.&#8217;s instead&#8230;. also used white whole wheat flour instead of white (my new fav. substitute, I use it in all things that require flour!) and they were perfect! almost gone now, 36 hours later (and we doubled the recipe&#8230;)</p>

				<p>I just made these cookies and instead of 2/3 cup brown sugar, I used 1/3 brown sugar and a little less than 1/3 of a cup of agave nectar since I ran out of brown sugar.  Other than that I followed it exactly.  They are yummy but a little dry.  could this be the agave?</p>

				<p>O.  M.  G.  Why, oh, why did I only make 1/2 batch?  These are AMAZING.  I, too, have struggled for years with oatmeal cookies.  The only way I could get them to stay even semi-soft was to add chopped apples.  These stay nice and chewy (at least as far as breakfast :) the next day).  I soaked the raisins in the egg and vanilla, as per some readers&#8217; suggestions.  I added a bit of fresh nutmeg, but no nuts.  Deb, your site is wonderful; you are truly gifted as a chef, photographer and writer.  I am hooked!  Thanks again.</p>

				<p>I made these cookies and they were really good. They turned out thick; like small cakes so I think next time I will try to press them a little more so I get a less dense cookie. Don’t take me wrong, it is a great cookie and you can really feel the oatmeal and it’s not overly sweet.</p>

				<p>thanks :) these were so good, i ended up doubling the recipe. i thought i&#8217;d have too many cookies but they vanished amongst friends in just 2 days. i definitely agree that freezing them or at chilling in fridge for a few hours is a must to bake better plumper cookies. these came out perfect..i&#8217;ve made oatmeal raisin before, but this time, everyone said they were the best they&#8217;d ever had and please make more :) thanks!</p>

				<p>I made these this afternoon and they turned out wonderful!!  I made a couple of alterations though.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and whole grain oats instead of rolled oats.  I was a little worried at first because they seemed like they were not moist enough when I mixed them, but after baking they were perfect!! This is definitely my new go-to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies!! Thanks!</p>

				<p>Resending my comment earlier today to correct a typo (backing powder instead o packing powder&#8230;)<br />
&#8212;<br />
Today I baked these great cookies per the original recipe but with the following changes:<br />
-Replaced half of the butter with honey to reduce fat<br />
-Replaced half the amount of raisins with cranberry raisins to add a little bitter taste. I stirred the raisins into the separate dry bowl right after the flour for a more even distribution.<br />
-Replaced half of the baking soda with backing powder<br />
The cookies came out great; as chewy and tasty as the original recipe but a little sweeter, and spongier.</p>

				<p>Making these today! Modifying by putting in dried cherries instead of raisins in half the batch. Thanks for another great recipe.</p>
