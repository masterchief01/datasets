[But I die and go to cookie heaven.] When <a href="http://www.doriegreenspan.com/dorie_greenspan/">Dorie Greenspan</a> included Pierre Herm&#233;&#8217;s recipe for to-die-for chocolate cookies in her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767906810?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0767906810">Paris Sweets cookbook</a>, she called them Korova Cookies (Sabl&#233;s Korova), after the restaurant off the Champs-&#201;lys&#233;es for which <a href="http://www.pierreherme.com/">Pierre Herm&#233;</a> created these cookies, not the milk bar in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/">A Clockwork Orange</a>. In her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618443363?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0618443363">most recent book</a>, she calls them World Peace Cookies, as her neighbor became convinced that a daily dose of these cookies was all that is needed to ensure planetary peace and happiness. </p>
<p>While world peace is truly a lofty and admirable goal, it&#8217;s unfortunately not cutting it in my apartment as if you were standing in front of me holding one, I would probably try to take it from you. (Just ask my husband.) I don&#8217;t know if it because this is another frantic entry in those <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/10/and-then-i-went-shoe-shopping ">28-day</a>, <a href=" http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/ganached-guinness-goodness">must eat chocolate</a> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/08/no-teddy-bear-guts-no-glory ">or else</a> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/chocolate-concise ">I will die</a>, files or because they are the best chocolate cookie I have eaten in my entire life but there is nothing peaceful about my relationship to them. </p>
<p>My original intention was to do what I typically do when I want to make something gloriously unhealthy but limit my intake of it &#8212; bring the remainders to work, foisting the calories on those youthful things with whom I share cubicle walls. But, unable to part with them, we&#8217;ve hidden them in the freezer which I can assure you, is not working either. They&#8217;re not even particularly charming when frozen, but they do still exist, or at least several of them do. So there&#8217;s that. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/346134488/" title="trying to hide away the world peace cookies"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/165/346134488_e04f014cb3.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="trying to hide away the world peace cookies" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-171"></span></p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet abruptly stopped reading this tired-and-typical battle of weak will versus good intention and rushed to the kitchen to gather your butter and cocoa, perhaps this will convince you: the cookies are as sandy and light as you would expect from a sable, but dark as midnight and as zeroed-in on flavor as a pressed fudge brownie. It&#8217;s impossible to eat one warm from the oven without a milk chaser, right from the carton. Those tiny dabs of bittersweet chocolate are like that good thing that happens on a day you thought couldn&#8217;t get any better. &#8220;For me? You shouldn&#8217;t have!&#8221; But she did. And I did. And it&#8217;s getting bad, so bad that I didn&#8217;t work from home today as I had originally intended to for the sole purpose of putting some distance between me and World Peace. I&#8217;m sure you understand.</p>

<p><strong>* Okay, fine, I&#8217;ll say it</strong>: Some kind folks have nominated this here Smitten Kitchen for a <a href="http://wellfed.net/2007/01/03/top-5-best-food-blog-humor/">Best Food Blog &#8211; Humor Category</a> award over at the <a href="http://wellfed.net/">Well Fed network</a>. Um, me? Funny? If the people say so. Alas, I&#8217;m tr&#233;s flattered and encourage you to go over there and vote your conscience in this and all of the other categories. And then, <em>please</em>: Come over to my place and pry these cookies from my clutches. When I&#8217;m done with The Yelling and The Biting (and possibly, The Crying), I will thank you. I promise.
<p><b>World Peace/Korova Cookies</b><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767906810?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0767906810">Paris Sweets, Dorie Greenspan</a></p>
<p>Makes about 36 cookies</p>
<p>1 1/4 cups (175 grams) all-purpose flour<br />
1/3 cup (30 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1 stick plus 3 tablespoons (11 tablespoons or 150 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />
2/3 cup (120 grams) (packed) light brown sugar<br />
1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar<br />
1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel or 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
5 ounces (150 grams) bittersweet chocolate, chopped into chips, or a generous 3/4 cup store-bought mini chocolate chips</p>
<p>Sift the flour, cocoa and baking soda together. </p>
<p>Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy. Add both sugars, the salt and vanilla extract and beat for 2 minutes more. </p>
<p>Turn off the mixer. Pour in the flour, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitchen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek &#8212; if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more; if not, remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough &#8212; for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don&#8217;t be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate. </p>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. If you&#8217;ve frozen the dough, you needn&#8217;t defrost it before baking &#8212; just slice the logs into cookies and bake the cookies 1 minute longer.) </p>
<p><u>Getting ready to bake</u>: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325&#176;F (160&#176;C). Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. </p>
<p>Working with a sharp thin knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you&#8217;re cutting them &#8212; don&#8217;t be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.) Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving about one inch between them. </p>
<p>Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes &#8212; they won&#8217;t look done, nor will they be firm, but that&#8217;s just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies rest until they are only just warm, at which point you can serve them or let them reach room temperature. </p>
<p><u>Serving:</u> The cookies can be eaten when they are warm or at room temperature &#8212; I prefer them at room temperature, when the textural difference between the crumbly cookie and the chocolate bits is greatest &#8212; and are best suited to cold milk or hot coffee. </p>
<p><u>Do ahead:</u> Packed airtight, cookies will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days (Deb note: not a chance); they can be frozen for up to 2 months. They can also be frozen in log form for months, and can be sliced and baked directly from the freezer, adding a coupld minutes to the baking time.</p>

				<p>Ok, right after I post this, I&#8217;m trying these cookies! It&#8217;ll give me something to do while my no-knead-dough is rising&#8230; Yes, you have convinced me to try it, I&#8217;ll let you know how it came out! Also, I&#8217;ve made it my project for this month (and probably a few to come) to read ALL of your archives, as I&#8217;ve only recently discovered your site. By the way, I LOVE it! I want to try so many recipes of yours I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s enough hours in a day! Best of luck on the Food Blog Award, I will definitely vote for you!</p>

				<p>ok so earlier i came here to look at that pizza dough recipe again so i could stir it together (and i did!) but then i looked at your flickr and saw those pictures and learned their name in the tags and then hunted down greenspan&#8217;s recipe because this post wasn&#8217;t quite up yet and i couldn&#8217;t wait and now..  oh.  Now.  </p>
<p>These are perfect.</p>
<p>Reading your post about these cookies was the perfect chaser to the cookie/s and milk I had a few minutes ago.</p>

				<p>OKAY&#8230;You had me at chocolate.  Since you teased yesterday I&#8217;ve been eagerly anticipating the appearance of this cookie recipe. I was given chocolate that was lovingly produced in Belgium and I believe these cookies are worthy of a bar.  And, because it so highly reccomended by our the lovely authoress, I&#8217;m saving this page as it&#8217;s own favorite so I&#8217;ll be sure to make them after I move. </p>
<p>As my opinion towards the nomination: DEB YOU&#8217;RE HILARIOUS!  Do you know how many times I have to stifle laughter at work when reading your prose? Sheesh woman, you&#8217;re the Erma Bombeck of cooking in my book!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m taking your mention of mushrooms as the sign that I was right &#8211; you&#8217;re the person I must ask. What would you do with a pound of dried shiitake mushrooms? I received 2 bags, 1/2 pound each, and want to put them to good use. </p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

My husband says they are the best cookies he&#8217;s ever eaten, and I definitely agree! Thank you so much for the recipe, I will be baking them over and over again once my kids get a taste! IF there are any left in the morning!</p>

<p>I MUST try these cookies!  Oh, and any idea how long those beautiful brownies can be left in the freezer?  I just found a package I hid there about 2 months ago.  I sure would like to have one&#8230;two&#8230;three&#8230;</p>

				<p>ok, now just a minute here&#8230;.i have been touting my World Peace Cookies at my blog since before Christmas, not one bit aware (or caring) that there actually WAS a cookie that was called this intentionally. Do we need a World Peace Cookie Off???? Should there be voting?? A duel? Clashing of swords??</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;..wait, it&#8217;s about Peace, right? I guess then dueling is out of the question, huh?</p>
<p>I suppose if anyone was going to top me in my quest for the best chocolate cookie, it has to be you, Deb</p>

				<p>These look divine&#8211;and came out of my oven tasing divine, but something went terribly wrong with the texture.  They melted into one big, shiny puddle: greasy on the bottom and thin like tuiles.  What could I have done wrong?  I followed the recipe, but used salted butter and a hand mixer.  Any advice for next time would be great as they do taste wonderful!!</p>

				<p>Hi! These look great. I don&#8217;t know how the cookies are, but the dough tastes awesome! Most of it is resting in the fridge, but I ate the &#8220;scrap&#8221; pieces. I can&#8217;t wait another 2 hours to bake them. I guess I should go clean the kitchen now, it should take up some time&#8230;</p>

				<p>I second LyB&#8217;s opinion on the bread &#8211; I made it today and was very impressed with it.  Now I want to find a pan to make a higher loaf.  I used a 2.5 qt corning ware round casserole dish and it turned out lovely and higher than most of the pictures that I have seen, just not high enough for my taste.  My house now smells all yeasty.</p>

				<p>I feel remiss in not mentioning this earlier, but I so did NOT wait three hours for my dough to chill. Three hour waits and impulse/PMS-driven cooking are different languages. About 30 minutes in the freezer did the trick. </p>
<p>Lizzy &#8211; Not sure, except that something clearly went wrong. Egads. Try it again if you have the energy left, I can&#8217;t imagine (unless it&#8217;s an oven temp issue, but even that would give a different result) it could happen twice!</p>

				<p>Ok, the cookies were yummy, though I must admit, a bit on the dry side. This of course is my fault. I grated the chocolate instead of just chopping it into chunks, and I used my hot air oven, so the oven was probably too hot and the cookies got too much. </p>
<p>But! I then got a great idea! I&#8217;m gonna try it again, though making the logs thicker, and the slices thinner. Then, when the cookies are done and cooled off, I&#8217;ll slap on some vanilla cream and make home made oreos of them. Any ideas on a filling recipe?</p>

				<p>Oh, man.  These were included in the splendid kitchen email before xmas, and I made them.  I made 7 batches.  I&#8217;d forgotten about them until a recent request from a friend saw me summon up all my energy (life is *hard*) and make them again.  For a real salt fix (and delicious burn on the tongue), I sprinkled each with a few tiny rocks of fleur de sel before baking.  Gah!</p>

				<p>How can you call these &#8220;World Peace&#8221; cookies?  The name invokes good feelings  because descent humans long for world peace and by eating this cookie that end must somehow be getting closer.  And yet this cookie does nothing to further our progress towards that goal.  I could see if this cookie were composed of ingredients easily acquired and common in most areas of the world then we could all enjoy this cookie and put our trite controversies behind us.  But instead this cookie instills hate.  I can make this delicious cookie and freely enjoy it whenever I want while my less fortunate fellows cannot; this freedom to enjoy this wonderful cookie is one more freedom that the oppressed envy and hate us for.</p>

				<p>i made these last night, as [drumroll, please] the First! Ever! batch of cookies i&#8217;ve made as an adult (that&#8217;s what 2 decades of an eating disorder will do to you&#8230; ).  i ate a few, the friend i&#8217;d invited over for dinner ate a few, then i packaged the rest in a little box i&#8217;d drawn cartoons on and left them on the doorstep of an overworked 30-something friend in need of a pick-me-up.  just plopped them on his doorstep, rang the bell, and ran.  this morning i got a note: &#8220;best cookie sneak attack ever!&#8221;  yep, i&#8217;ll be making these again.</p>

				<p>I was SO looking forward to making these, and the raw mix tasted great (I have an egg allergic friend I was looking forward to having taste these) but I dont know what I did wrong, must have had too much butter as it just spread out into one burnt crumbly mass in the oven :(</p>

				<p>I had the opposite problem. The dough tasted good but after baking, the cookies were way too dry and a crumbly.  Maybe I got the flour to butter proportions wrong. I don&#8217;t know, could I have used 1 1/2 cups flour ? Would that had made this much difference? Oh well. I&#8217;ll give it one more try.</p>

				<p>I have been having the same problem with hiding cookies in the freezer! I make cookies, tell myself I&#8217;ll freeze most of them for moderate, gradual consumption, and then proceed to gobble them up within a few days anyway. It&#8217;s easy to convince yourself that life is too short not to enjoy something so good. Can&#8217;t wait to tempt myself with this recipe.</p>

				<p>Okay, I know these are supposed to be &#8220;World Peace Cookies,&#8221; but seriously, the fights that have broken out in our house over who gets the next one?  Not contributing to any peace yet.  </p>
<p>I have, however, guaranteed my friends will love me forever with these as a gift.  :)</p>

				<p>After gearing up for months I finally made these cookies, and have no idea what I did wrong!  The dough was so crumbly that I could barely roll it, and a few hours later when I tried to slice it, the rolls crumbled back into pieces!  (Of course, then I had to eat some of the dough, which was fantastic!).  Any thoughts before I try this again?</p>

				<p>Came across your recipe by accident and made these on Saturday. They were extremely popular.I explained the reason for the name to Patrick, my 11 year-old grandson, who would have happily eaten the lot. . . His reaction was that they would cause a war because people would be fighting over them! So in this family they will be known as &#8220;World War lll Cookies&#8221;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these twice now and both times they were a crumbly mess. The dough was delicious (I mean, I seriously ate like half of it before baking. Seriously. Really.), but it would not press into a log. I forced it into a log shape with some plastic wrap and put it in the fridge and then when I tried to slice it, it all just crumbled apart. I&#8217;m certain I measured the ingredients right. Maybe some butters have different water content? I wonder if I could add a tablespoon of milk or cream to the dough to bring it together&#8230;</p>

				<p>I just tried these (the &#8220;logs&#8221; are in the freezer right now) and the dough was VERY crumbly. I halved the recipe (I am 100% positive my amounts and ingredients are all correct). I got it to press into roundish shapes that vaguely resemble logs, but it was practically dry. I did use Earth Balance (soy margarine) instead of butter, as I&#8217;m a vegan, but I&#8217;ve baked everything else with it and it works wonderfully. Just how crumbly should it be?</p>

				<p>Same problem! Dough is too crumbly. I put the crumbled mess on a plate, microwaved it to soften the butter and re-rolled the dough. It rolled a lot better and Im going to slice it tomorrow, hoping it wont all fall apart. Good luck to everyone else!</p>

				<p>My friend and I made these a few weeks ago while I was visiting her, and we had the same issue with the dough being extremely crumbly (although we managed to sort of get it into a log, and then once it had been in the fridge for an hour it cohered a bit better).</p>
<p>BUT, I just made them at home, and the dough wasn&#8217;t crumbly at all. I don&#8217;t know what can account for the variance; my friend did the measuring last time and I did it this time, so maybe it&#8217;s even just a matter of her overmeasuring flour and my undermeasuring it&#8230;</p>

				<p>For the people with crumbly dough &#8211; I beat the butter a long time, more than the full two minutes with the sugars.  Is it possible the butter isn&#8217;t creamed as much as it should be?  Or was maybe too cold?  Try warming it up and beating it a little extra than the 2 minutes?</p>

				<p>kitt &#8212; Interesting theory! This time I did beat the butter for several minutes, *and* I think the butter might have been closer to room temperature than it was last time. If that&#8217;s what the source of the difference is, it&#8217;s amazing that so much change could come from such a small discrepancy in ingredients.</p>

				<p>Elise, Ross, etc. &#8212; Yes, the dough is indeed a bit crumbly. Dorie warns in the recipe above that it probably will crack, and just to squeeze the cookie disks back together if they do. I find that taking them from the fridge rather than the freezer (which I often use for longer-term storage, i.e. planning ahead) helps, if nothing else, leaving it out on the counter for ten or fifteen minutes. I also find that it is the end pieces that crumble the most for me. I am glad that it has no effect on the final taste, however!</p>

				<p>what a letdown!! i was looking for something to rival the &#8220;dark chocolate oatmeal cookies&#8221; from epicurious and this is not it. i highly recommend the epicurious cookies and will use my remaining chocolate to make up a batch of those. i may or may not try these again.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m not a novice baker and i thought these sounded like a good holiday cookie. i had the same problem as others: dough was almost too crumbly. i had a lot of trouble slicing the dough and it fell apart. i also could not incorporate the amount of dry ingredients called for in the recipe without a lot more beating than the recipe indicates. i found it very hard to get all the flour blended.<br />
the first batch cooked at 325 burned in less than 12 minutes (the bottoms) so i lowered to 300 and subsequent batch did not burn. i followed the recipe pretty exactly (i could not find mini chips so i used regular sized chips and chopped them up a bit, but they were too large for me to cut even 1/2&#8243; slices). the only other change i made was to use fructose instead of sugar (which i always do).<br />
the dough tasted fine but the baked cookies are pretty nondescript, kind of bitter and bland (except for what remains of the chips).</p>

				<p>Well, I am no great cookie baker, but I loved these, and I think they turned out pretty well. Yes, the dough is tough to handle, but with a bit of perseverance I battled it into submission and managed to make the logs and roll up and in the fridge. I did the cutting VERY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY and most were fine. I used the mini morsels and they were perfect. I must admit to overbaking them a bit &#8211; they could have been a LITTLE less crisy. But the flavor was tremendous, and my family loved them. I am all set to do again and watch the bakign time.</p>

				<p>I found one &#8220;alternative&#8221; solution to the crumbly dough. It did form into a log, but when I tried slicing, the chocolate chips would be stronger than the dough and instead of just &#8220;chipping&#8221; apart, the whole segment of log with crumble. I noticed that the longer i worked with the dough, and softer the dough got, the easier it was to cut. I microwaved the logs for about 15 seconds just to soften it all a tiny bit, and they cut with ease. Some still broke, but were easily pressed back together. Im sure I will try this recipe again to see if the outcome is different. I haven&#8217;t been dissatisfied with a single recipe from this site&#8230;and there is still so much more to explore&#8230;</p>

				<p>Hi, long time reader, first time commenter.</p>
<p>I just finished making these and found that most times I tried to slice the log, the slice crumbled into tiny pieces.  I do wonder if, as Ross found, that slicing them warm would be easier.  That, or I&#8217;d prefer to just keep the dough in the mixing bowl, take tablespoon-size scoops out, and form those into flat cookie shapes.  I felt rather silly slicing and re-forming each cookie from bits of chocolate dust.</p>
<p>That said, THESE ARE AMAZING.  I needed a gift to thank a young frenchman for a bottle of wine he brought me back from Paris and I knew these would be perfect.</p>

				<p>So I finally got around to making these&#8230; only a year or so late. And, well, this is the sound of me dying of happiness and going to dessert heaven. These cookies are incredible! They&#8217;re like a chocolate opera with faint caramel harmonies. They&#8217;re not just good &#8212; they&#8217;re two-glasses-of-milk-per-cookie good. I will definitely be making these again&#8230; like in two hours, which is when the current batch will be gone.<br />
(By the way, I had no trouble incorporating the flour or cutting the chilled dough&#8230; perhaps because I used VERY soft butter to start with.)</p>

				<p>Hey &#8211; I&#8217;m in a bit of a jam &#8211; please help! </p>
<p>I love these cookies and made them a few weeks ago.  I&#8217;m moving next week, and trying to empty out the pantry and get rid of *everything*.  Can I use self-rising flour for these?  How much baking soda do you think I should leave out?</p>
<p>These would be a perfect thank you to everyone who is helping me move &#8211; but I really don&#8217;t want to buy more flour until I&#8217;m settled in my new kitchen&#8230;</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not generally a huge chocolate cookie fan, but these were indescribably good. Had a little trouble slicing the dough (a lot less trouble than most commenters, it seems), but I just ate the scraps. As delicious as the cookies are, I think the dough might be even better.</p>

				<p>I tried these (twice) last week, one batch for us, another one (after trying them) for a friend&#8217;s birthday party. The first batch I did with 72% cocoa chips, and it tasted better than the second batch, which I did with 55% &#8220;fondant&#8221; chocolate. My, there are some cookies still left from the first batch, and I don&#8217;t who to give them to&#8230; I guess I&#8217;ll have to eat them! :-)</p>
<p>I had no problem with the crumbliness while making the logs, but the discs did break a lot of times while slicing. I think, like Deb says, that leaving them on the counter 5 minutes helps, but also the thinness of the knife. I tried with a regular knife and everything fell appart, and then I tried with a &#8220;cuchillo jamonero&#8221;, the one that is used to slice cured ham, and things changed radically. </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>Hey! Just made this recipe and had my gang try them: they blew the gang&#8217;s minds, I can tell you that :-) And believe me,  those guys, they&#8217;re not easy to impress, since they are used to me using them as guinea pigs for anything edible that I fancy making.  I used brown sugar (the kind that&#8217;s called rapadura or mascobado) and these. cookies. were. SCRUMPTIOUS! The touch of fleur de sel is just what they need to kick up the strong cocoa flavor. I used 70% cocoa chocolate for the chips, and used good quality organic butter and spelt flour. I used a sharp kitchen knife to slice the logs, and had no trouble at all with crumbly bits. And the smell, and the look when they start to voluptuously spread in the oven&#8230; and the taste once they&#8217;ve reached room temperature, the crumbliness, the concentrated flavor explosion. Heaven indeed. I have copied the recipe in my little red notebook, the one with the very few recipes I just KNOW I want to keep making and be able to pass around as people come to me begging for the recipe. I wanted to post them on my blog, but the gang did not leave a SINGLE one of them for me to take a picture, so it&#8217;ll have to wait until next time I make them. Which, I&#8217;m guessing, shouldn&#8217;t take too long.</p>

				<p>basically the greatest chocolate thing i&#8217;ve ever baked! i&#8217;ve been linking all of my friends to this recipe since i found it, but they&#8217;re all too LAZY to do it (just kidding, guys, if you&#8217;re reading this! but BAKE THESE NOW, YOU&#8217;RE MISSING OUT).</p>
<p>&#8230;i do sort of have to complain about the the whole shape-chill-slice process, though. the second time i made these i just scooped out tablespoonfuls of the powdery dough and used my palm to press it into the scoop&#8217;s hemisphere shape. they turned out pretty well again (just a teeny bit more crumbly), and i saved so much effort! ;-o</p>

				<p>Just made these cookies, I had a similar problem to many of you as they were very crumbly. It was a little bit difficult to get them into a roll, and then most of them crumbled when I tried to slice them. My butter was not quite at room temperature, and I used regular sized chocolate chips, so those things could partly be to blame.<br />
Despite the problems they are quite delicious and the saltiness is a fantastic addition!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been making these for over a year, with a hand mixer. I also do variations &#8211; drop the cocoa powder for regular chocolate cookies, use white white chunks instead and for Halloween used extra dark bars with select orange pieces. This is a good basic recipe that can be played with to suit different tastes. Always a hit whenever I make them.</p>

				<p>These are absolutely delicious!  I actually made these with 3/4 c whole wheat 1/2 c ap and they have a more substantial (but subtle) texture that I really like.  Try it if you like!  Thank you for this recipe!</p>

				<p>Oh Deb&#8230; ooooooh Deb! I threw in some ground-up coffee and ground-up candy cane. Best grown-up Christmas cookie I have ever tasted in my life!<br />

				<p>The first time I made this the dough was really crumbly too and not coming together, so I used my bare hands just until it got soft and doughy. Messy, but it got the job done! I tried it again today with dark chocolate chips&#8230; Mmmm.</p>

				<p>I just made these and, like cheryl, my dough was really crumbly so I packed each slice in a tablespoon measure and then popped it out onto the baking sheet.  Worked like a charm.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend the addition of Skor toffee bits (I used the Chipits ones with no chocolate).  Delicious!</p>

				<p>These are undoubtedly the best cookies ever.  No problem with all the crumbly stuff thanks to saran wrap and the freezer.  Just love them and surely with all the &#8220;World Peace&#8221; being baked this week it will help with the general feeling in the air.  Yes?<br />

				<p>I have heard many of my foodie friends raving about these cookies, so as we have had some snow-days in England this week (practically unheard of here!) I finally got round to making them&#8230;  and they are truly fabulous.  As my husband is currently away I thought it safest to only bake half a batch (I have frozen the other log of dough), and it&#8217;s a good job I did as I have eaten the lot I baked already.  Irresistible.  </p>
<p>I used white chocolate chunks in them which worked really well with the intensely dark cookie.  </p>
<p>Thanks for the addition of the metric measurements &#8211; I printed the recipe out before you did that, and spent ages trying to work out how much butter was in 11 tbsp&#8230;  Well worth the effort though!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these twice and they are fabulous, but impossible to get on the cookie sheet in one piece. I&#8217;ve chilled them for a brief time and overnight, and neither worked, lol. Maybe next time I&#8217;ll try forming circles from spoonfuls of unrefrigerated dough.</p>

				<p>It went like this:  I frantically searched the kitchen for, and found, 3 sadly small stashes of quality bittersweet choc., and even then I probably just barely made the chocolate requirement ounce-wise. I chopped it up finely, and hoped it was enough.  I was just under 3/4 of a cup of finely chopped chocolate.  However, I then stupidly messed up, and threw in 2 sticks of butter into the dough instead of the 1 stick plus the extra Tbl.;compounding that, I somehow overlooked the fact of required chilling till it was time to bake! Consequently was furious w/ myself.  Refrigerated the dough overnight, and baked them this very morning.  I didn&#8217;t get 36 out of the batch &#8211; perhaps 24, but I decided who cares at this point?  Mon Dieu, despite my dumb plebe mess-ups, these babies are real Come Hither Cookies.  I will make them again, for sure.  A new addition to the repertoire has arrived!  My youngest son comes home from school in less than 45 min. and boy will he be thrilled when he sees what I have wrought.  I can hear him now, &#8220;Oh, WOW &#8211; thanks!&#8221;  They are brilliant w/ cold milk.  Be sure to USE PARCHMENT PAPER on the PAN, and let them cool TILL FIRM enough to handle. The later took a lot of patience on my part!  Next time I will follow the recipe instructions, and DOUBLE the BATCH.</p>

				<p>these.were.divine. -thank you for sharing the recipe. BTW, I baked some both without and with the chilling step- the first ones as soon as the dough was mixed and then the rest as directed by forming into a log and refrigerating- because I didn&#8217;t want to wait! So the first half I scooped onto the sheet with a small scoop and flattened to the 1/2 inch thickness specified for the slicing and maybe baked a little short of the 12 min. The only difference I discerned was the appearance &#8211; the chilled and sliced cookies were &#8220;prettier&#8221; and the first were more rustic.</p>

				<p>I made these and they were delicious! However, the dough was so crumbly that I had to add a small egg, but after that it worked fine. </p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s hilarious how a cookie seems to have mysteriously disappeared in both pictures- the empty grease circles give it away. ;)</p>

				<p>So, you&#8217;re gonna update the recipes with metric measurements! That would be such a big relief for someone like me, living in Europe. I&#8217;m always in trouble when it comes to cups.

				<p>Have made TWO batches in the past two days.  First batch- crumbly but delicious.  Then I read readers comments and heeded the advice to be sure the butter was at room TEMP.  YAY!!! HUGE SUCCESS.<br />
I gave a few to friends.  They commented that couldn&#8217;t POSSIBLY be called WORLD PEACE cookies since anyone eating them would be fighting the others for their cookies! :-D</p>

				<p>Why, oh why, oh why did I not see this YESTERDAY?! I made a whole batch of chocolate cookies from another website, and can&#8217;t feed them to ANYONE because they are awful. I should have made THESE!! I guess I know what I&#8217;ll be doing this evening&#8230;.<br />
Though it&#8217;s a hard fight between these and the cream cheese pound cake.<br />

				<p>I made these yesterday. They are spectacular. I had no problems with crumbliness &#8211; over here butter gets to room temperature (30 degrees centigrade) very quickly &#8211; and I popped them into the freezer for one hour instead of refridgerating for 3 as it was 10.30pm and my husband HAD to have one before he went to sleep. I can&#8217;t wait to try the peanut butter variation Dorie talks about on her website!! I have a new confidence with cookies. Should have made a double batch!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d reiterate that the butter really does need to be a room temperature for these, and I think the dough mixing would have been a LOT easier if I&#8217;d had a stand mixer, rather than a boyfriend with (admittedly impressive) biceps, doing the mixing. I popped them in the fridge for about half an hour and then got sick of waiting and put them in the freezer for another hour &#8211; they sliced beautifully and didn&#8217;t crumble, but they did splurge out a lot in the oven and did NOT look like the beautifully-proportioned ones in the pictures. I am not deterred, however, as they were yummy, and it turned out they only went all thin and crispy because aforementioned kitchen help had turned the Rayburn up to roast his vegetables properly (not a euphemism). So next time I&#8217;ll make sure the butter is super-soft first and will keep the oven at 160. Has anyone attempted this with melted butter or would that be disastrous?</p>

				<p>I have made these 3 times since finding the recipe in February and have another batch cooling in the fridge.  They are the most requested chocolate thing I make now.  I&#8217;ve had varied results with the dough, sometimes crumbly, sometimes not, but they always seem to slice well and bake up perfectly.  On my first batch I sprinkled fleur de sel on the tops of half the batch before baking.  People were so ga ga over the sweet/salty combination that now I bake every batch that way.  Thanks for the recipe and the blog!  This is my go-to website when I need something edgy and sure-to-be-good!  By the way, the Moroccan Chickpea stew is phenomenal!</p>

				<p>These cookies were better than I expected.  And believe me, I expected them to be very good! &#8212; seeings how I&#8217;ve loved every recipe I&#8217;ve tried on SmittenKitchen. These are not like a typical chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  They take it to a whole &#8216;nother level. These are very special chocolate cookies and easy too.</p>

				<p>I made them, and they&#8217;re fantatic! I made a slight alteration for a friend that really likes raisins, and replacing 1/3 of the chocolate bits with raisins works great, too.

				<p>Yum, just had one still slightly warm out of the oven&#8230;heavenly. My sister made these once, and they were fantastic, although she complained about the chocolate chips causing them to break while slicing, and from reading above posts, I was also worried that my butter was too chilly still, so I killed two birds with one stone and gave my butter extra time to warm up while I sliced each little square of chocolate with a sharp knife- practically flaking it. The result was a cramped hand, but also easily sliceable dough, with only a couple cookies breaking into halves, which were easily reshaped. The flakes also mean that the chocolate spreads into more of the cookies, instead of retaining it&#8217;s chip form. Thanks for the recipe, my boyfriend is going to love them (if there are any left when he gets home)!</p>

				<p>DIVINE!!!! I definately prefer salty to sweet and never have problems passing on cookies, cakes, etc. but I have already had two warm cookies. I am frantically trying to think of how I am going to stop myself from eating the whole batch by myself before morning&#8230;..<br />
Chocolate chips are hard to come by where I live, so I cut a square of dark chocolate into chips. That probably explains why the logs crumbled so much when cut.<br />
Thank you!!</p>

				<p>Question &#8211; I loved these cookies but I have a question about the texture?  Are they supposed to be like a &#8220;sandy?&#8221;  Mine were kind of gritty for lack of a better word.  My husband was totally turned off by the texture &#8211; my first reaction was great, all the more for me but I could kind of see where he was coming from and thought I should ask.  I didn&#8217;t have any issues rolling in to a log or cutting &#8211; a couple crumbly bits but nothing significant.  I find them kind of sandy but then once in your mouth they kind of carmelize &#8211; I don&#8217;t know if that makes sense.  Any insight on texture would be helpful.</p>

				<p>Thanks Deb! It&#8217;s the second time I try to propagate world peace by making these cookies. The first time I was really confused by the crumbiness of the dough, so I added more butter. They tasted amazing; they were gone within the hour. However, they were shapeless and not too appetizing to the eye. The second time I followed the recipe word for word, and they turned out perfect! Follow the recipe and don&#8217;t fear the crumbling dough.</p>

				<p>I have a question- these are one of my favorite cookies, and I have made them for the past two years for christmas. Right now I&#8217;m brainstorming cookie recipes to send to my friend in Iraq, and I was wondering if you thought these would still be good without the chocolate chips. (And if I would have to adjust the cooking time)</p>
<p>Chocolate melts too much to send. In my  memory these didn&#8217;t have chips, but now that I see the recipe, of course they do. I have a chocolate crinkle recipe on deck, but part of me would rather do a recipe I&#8217;m familiar with.</p>

				<p>These cookies are next on my list to make.    I&#8217;m curious how they compare to an amazingly good cookie in Clotilde Dusolier&#8217;s Chocolate &amp; Zucchini cookbook in which she uses bittersweet chocolate, dutch cocoa and cacao nibs.   The cacao nibs are what make her cookies over the top:</p>
<p><a href="http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2006/02/chocolate_and_cacao_nib_cookies.php" rel="nofollow">http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2006/02/chocolate_and_cacao_nib_cookies.php</a></p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll be curious to see how these cookies compare with Dusolier&#8217;s.</p>

				<p>I made this particular cookie just to try it. I think that this recipie could be spiced up a bit by adding one of my favrioute things to add to a chochlate chip cookie, pecans. This gives it a richer flavor.</p>

				<p>These might be the best cookies I&#8217;ve ever made &#8211; thanks for the recipe!  I added dark chocolate chunks&#8230;so chocolately but not overly sweet!  By the way I&#8217;m a big fan of your site here :)</p>

				<p>I made these cookies last night for a dinner party, and besides being incredibly delicious, they are also perfect for mini ice cream sandwiches! These are definitely my New Favorite Chocolate Cookies&#8211;they&#8217;re tasty, the ingredients are easy to find, and they&#8217;re not overly fussy.</p>

				<p>Hm I can tell from looking at the recipe that there may be too much flour.  Usually crumbliness means there&#8217;s too much flour in the recipe.  Thats also why very soft butter would help..add more softness to the dough.  Also, flour can vary greatly by brand and type.  </p>
<p>I will DEFINITELY make these since I am looking for a new chocolate cookie recipe (I&#8217;m currently using Ina Garten&#8217;s double chocolate ones- they&#8217;re decent).  Maybe I will try adding a few tablespoons less flour first and see what happens.  :)</p>

				<p>Just made these today and all I can say is, following directions to the &#8220;T&#8221;, this recipe will yeild cookies that are yum, but mediocre. From a chocolate lover&#8217;s standpoint, these will not dissappoint. But regular chocolate chip cookies nix half the effort and are yummier, to me. </p>
<p>As far as being no-fuss, the first time, mine were overburnt, 2nd batch, overdone, 3rd batch, juusssttt right. But even with the goldielocks charm of the thrice-try batch, these cookies didn&#8217;t win me over. To credit the author :), these are yum, but cocoa powder is a tricky thing, and even meticulous methology can&#8217;t cure these cookies and fix em&#8217; a place in my faves, or even my &#8220;likes&#8221;. Maybe it&#8217;s me; maybe it&#8217;s cocoa powder. But either way, I won&#8217;t be making these again.</p>

				<p>hello again&#8230; alright I made these today.  I take back what I said about too much flour &#8211; it was just right.  After reading the other comments, I made sure the butter was VERY soft  (zapped it in the microwave 5 seconds at a time until it got soft), and that did the trick.  My dough was not crumbly at all, actually, it was just perfectly soft.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t bother to chill the dough/shape it into logs either, it&#8217;s one of those things that I hate doing like sifting flour, so I just measured them out with a tablespoon and flattened them slightly on the pan.  Perfect!!</p>
<p>The taste is amazing.  The cocoa powder gave it a really intense chocolatey flavour.  I have only had one so far (but I ate a lot of dough), but the inside is chewy, fudgy, dense, and soft, *almost* like a brownie, and the edges slightly crisp.  I used 70% bittersweet Lindt chocolate and it adds an amazing flavour.  These are my new favourites.  I love Ina too, but her double chocolate ones have more ingredients and are a bit dry &#8211; they will be replaced by these :D</p>

				<p>I never go wrong with your recipes and picks. I made these last night and are wonderful. I subbed for mint choco chips because I had a specific craving. Came out fantastic and sliced perfectly. Yes the batter was crumbly, but this cookie is NOT suppose to be uber chewy correct?</p>

				<p>Just wanted to let people know. I tried the &#8220;technique&#8221; from the espresso shortbread cookies, where you roll them out in a 1-gallon freezer bag and then chill and cut them into 1 1/2 inch squares, and it worked WONDERFULLY. I always hated the part where you form it into logs and then when I sliced them they always crumbled. Using the freezer bag made it SO easy. I cooked them the same amount of time. Perfect.</p>
<p>Also, when I have made these and the dough seems a little dry, I just add a 1/2 t more vanilla extract. That is just enough to pull it together, and since it&#8217;s mostly alcohol, it doesn&#8217;t affect the final cookie.</p>
<p>These cookies are a favorite of ours, and with the freezer bag technique, I&#8217;ll probably be making them more often.</p>

				<p>For those who had crumbliness problems &#8212; I ignored the instruction not to overmix, and mixed until the dough held together.  Then the crumbliness was not an issue, and the cookies tasted just fine.  In fact, much better than just fine.  In fact, WAAAYYY better than just fine.  They are insanely good.</p>
<p>I had seen this recipe before and the name put me off.  Yes, I saw the list of ingredients, but still the name &#8220;World Peace Cookies&#8221; made me think of something healthy and heavy and earnest, something out of the old Moosewood Cookbook and I ignored the recipe.  Your title, Deb, intrigued me, and after reading your description I had to try them.  And I have to say, they are more likely to spark fights than peace &#8212; fights over who gets to eat them.  Just yesterday my husband took the last one, which was lying on a plate, and he thought was &#8220;leftover&#8221; but was in fact sitting and waiting for my 5-year old daughter&#8217;s 5-year old friend to eat.  I ask you, does snatching cookies from a 5-year old sound like a recipe for world peace?</p>

				<p>I thought I would add to the abundant discussion here to sing the praises of these cookies. They even survived the butchering of an inattentive baker (that&#8217;s me!). I made these gluten and dairy free, and cut down the brown sugar by about half. And, uh, I may have forgotten to add baking soda! I was distracted!<br />
They were still delicious without leavening, but in the future I would probably keep the sugar as is, or only cut it a little bit. Most dessert recipes taste way too sweet for me and so I decrease the sugar, but these might actually be perfect or near-perfect as is.</p>

				<p>Hi, Deb &#8211; Ever since I first found your site last summer, I&#8217;ve spent about 5 hours her EVERY DAY.  Your brown butter brown sugar shorties inspired a baking frenzy that I simply can&#8217;t (and refuse to) shake!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning on making these cookies tonight (though I should be writing my book and doing my laundry), but I&#8217;m considering eliminating anything peaceful about them and adding just a tad of chili powder for a kick of &#8220;yowza.&#8221;  I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes!</p>
<p>The baking frenzy continues&#8230;. [Thanks, Deb!  Your site has literally changed my life!]</p>

				<p>Just wanted to let you know that I made the cookies with the little twist I mentioned above &#8212; adding about a teaspoon of cayenne and some chili powder for depth of flavor &#8212; and these cookies were&#8230;..wow wow WOWZA!  After the third bite you really start feeling the heat of the cayenne!  It was a fantastic addition to the rich, sweet chocolate flavor.  My boyfriend thought they were a teensy bit too spicy (though still &#8220;edible&#8221;) but everyone else LOVED them and asked for the recipe.  </p>
<p>Next time, I&#8217;d like to add the spiciness again, but I was thinking about making them a bit chewier and adding dried cherries for a little tang.  What would you recommend for making chewier (rather than crispy) cookies?  Adding egg?  Shorter cooking time?</p>

				<p>I finally made these today, after months of reading about them, and &#8211; thank you!  They are so very good.  Tonight I topped one with a scoop of Archer Farms Red Tart Cherry preserves, and oh my lord.  Now when I watch Nigella Lawson make her chocolate cherry trifle, I&#8217;ll have a shortcut to ease my craving.  Heavenly!</p>

				<p>Why worry if they are crumbly?  When ever mine is a too crumbly &#8220;failure&#8221;, my family cheers as they now have a &#8220;refrigerator&#8221; cookie.  Meaning, we leave the dough in the refrigerator and just eat them directly from there with a spoon, skipping the baking step.  (Thanks for the tip on the butter temp though, I&#8217;ve been making these for years and wondered why I had variable results!)</p>

				<p>I need help. Seriously, I require assistance. Please. It&#8217;s 5am and I&#8217;ve just raided the fridge. I had two painstakingly crafted logs of World Peace chilling in there, awaiting their fate as presents for a friend later today. </p>
<p>Two 8 inch logs have now mysteriously morphed into a pair of 2 inch&#8230; stumps. I don&#8217;t know what came over me, but it was something akin to demonic possession, I think. &#8220;Go on, Isla,&#8221; the voice cooed in my ear. &#8220;In the interests of quality control you really should sample that dough. You know, just to be on the safe side.&#8221; So I did. And, heaven help me, one slice and I could -not- stop.</p>
<p>I feel like I need a confessional box right now. Or flagellation with wet noodles. Or something. I actually paused mid-gorging to get a tub of dulce de leche ice cream out of the freezer, and I had a scoop of that with slices of World Peace on top. I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that the combination was quite possibly the most knee-knockingly, synapse-incineratingly lethal taste experience I think I&#8217;ve ever had. I kind of feel like I&#8217;ve just been hit by a truck, or ravished by a ginormous chocolate-smothered pirate. </p>
<p>Is this what a World Peace OD feels like? I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m thinking that I shouldn&#8217;t make these things again unless I&#8217;m comfortable with someday being unceremoniously hoisted out of my home by a dozen burly paramedics armed with an aquarium whale sling and a crane. No more World Peace. No, definitely not. Nope. Definitely, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Not until next week anyway.</p>

				<p>YUM!  I added a tiny bantam egg since the dough was so dry, but I&#8217;d like to try it without egg for some friends with egg allergies.  After an hour in the freezer, I sliced and baked&#8230; very yummy!  I think they would be great without the choc chips too!</p>

				<p>I made these in a cooking class the other day, and we substituded fine salt with coarse sea salt.  I was worried but the rich chocolate with the crunch of the sea salt is an out.of.this.world combo!!</p>

				<p>Wow! Wowowowowowowowow! I&#8217;m a chocolate addict &amp; these cookies are a visit to heaven. Your instructions were really helpful &#8212; the sharp knife for cutting, the warning that they might crumble &amp; you can just piece them back together, and the fact that they won&#8217;t look done when the timer goes off. I simply trusted your directions completely, changed nothing, and they came out perfectly! I did make one mistake &#8212; my roll was only 1 inch thick instead of 1-1/2 inches. When I realized that, I just reduced the cooking time to 10 minutes. Besides, smaller cookies means I get to eat more of them, right?</p>

				<p>Well, they&#8217;re still delicious, but I&#8217;ve made the recipe twice now and both times they&#8217;ve spread out into a very thin, somewhat greasy puddle. I&#8217;ve changed different things to try to get them to look the way yours do (that is, shapely and still 1/2 inch thick): once I weighed the ingredients, once I went by volume, for one batch I lowered the temperature to 300, I tried reducing the baking time to 10 minutes, and I chilled for 3 hours, and more.  It made no difference. Ideas?</p>

				<p>Re the spreading &#8211; I&#8217;ve made these three times now.  The first time they did spread, although they were still delicious &#8211; big thin chewy chocolate cookies rather than thicker chunkier ones.  The subsequent two times they have been absolutely fine.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s to do with the heat of the oven.  The first time I made them I made them in logs that were about 2&#8243; thick with very big chunks of chocolate.  I think the key is to make the logs fairly small (1&#8243; to 1.5&#8243; as the recipe stipulates) and then cut the cookies generously thick (say a quarter to a half inch thick), and to make sure that your chocolate chips are small.  The cookies will look pathetically small when you cut them off to bake them but they do turn into generous, thick, sandy-textured chocolate chip masterpieces once they&#8217;ve cooled.</p>

				<p>In other words, I think they&#8217;re meant to spread, and the trick is to cut them very small and thick so that when they spread they spread into a proper cookie.</p>

				<p>Hmmmm&#8230;I just made these and they turned out absolutely perfect. Did everyone make sure they added the baking soda? Also, I cut them larger because I used them in ice cream sandwich and they were still fine- didn&#8217;t spread at all. I wonder if it&#8217;s an issue with altitude or something odd like that? As far as the crumb issue- I cut mine after only freezing for a half an hour and yes they were crumbly but I did it VERY carefully so they didn&#8217;t fall apart. And if you&#8217;re looking for something festive- add some peppermint ice cream in the middle and roll in crushed peppermint candies- delicious!</p>

				<p>Thanks for sharing yet another good recipe. I added a bit of cayenne pepper and topped it with sea salt as someone had suggested. Gave it a nice sweet, salt, hint of spice.</p>

				<p>I had no problem with the dough being crumbly, and I only froze for an hour.  (Impatience, of course.  But then again, I also started making cookies at past 8pm.)  Impatience also made me microwave frozen (salted) butter on 10 sec increments until mostly soft, omit the salt entirely otherwise, and just keep the kitchenaid a-pumpin&#8217; until it became a soft gooey butter-sugar deliciousness.</p>
<p>I also used regular sized chocolate chips, but my knife is really sharp and a firm hand cut right through the chocolate chips.  (Sharpen your knives, people!)</p>
<p>And.. they just came out of the oven&#8230; beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  I love them!  Boyfriend has already requested a large glass of milk and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what those are, but I want milk with them.&#8221;  Love it!  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb &#8211; I just made these, they&#8217;re very good!  I like the bit of saltiness from the fleur de sel (which I used for the first time today).   Do ya think I could sprinkle some on top for added fleur de sel goodness? Thanks for your input!</p>

				<p>Just made these to bring to a housewarming, and they are spectacular! Butter was pretty cold, but it eliminated the need to chill the dough, which was easy to work with and sliced well. Must have sliced a bit thick though (or more likely, eaten wayy more dough than I thought&#8230;) because it only made 20 cookies.  Came out a cross between brownie bites and shortbread! Yummm. Also substituted 1/4c. of all purpose flour with whole wheat, and used dark brown sugar over light. Will definitely try with some spice next time (and make them smaller). Thanks!</p>

				<p>Cookie heaven is just one egg away from this recipe :) It solves all sorts of problems &#8211; crumbliness, lack of chewiness, etc. I had to make them 3 times to realise that!<br />
Thank you, Deb, for all the wonderful recipes! With your help, I look like a real chef to my friends!</p>

				<p>Just had one of these cookies yesterday bought in a local bakery.<br />
It was so, so good that I just googled it by the off chance it was someone else&#8217;s cookie&#8230;and here it is!  The one I ate had grey sea salt sprinkled on top- someone mentioned that above and was just a fantastic touch.  If given a chance, this cookie really could heal the world.</p>
