	<div class="entry-body">
		<p>Throughout this season (and beyond), you're gonna hear me talking a lot about the "glove trick." Some of you already know about this, but for those who don't, here's the story...</p>

<p>When I was eight, I saw a fan on TV using a fishing pole to lower an empty soup can over a ball that was sitting beyond his reach on the field below. The can descended...slowly...slowly...until it dropped over the ball, and when the guy lifted it, the ball was gone. <i>Poof!</i> Just like that. I couldn't believe it, and the memory stuck.</p>

<p>Six years later, I started attending games regularly and began to drool over all the balls that rolled into the left field corner during batting practice at Yankee Stadium. I tried to make my own can, but it was clunky and rarely worked when I practiced with it at home. I brought it to one game in 1992, but BP was wiped out by a last-minute thunderstorm, and I gave up on the idea.</p>

<p>The following season, inspiration struck. Instead of a can with sharp edges and three-pound dumbbells tied to the top, all I needed was my glove, a rubber band, a Sharpie, and some string. I practiced in my room, and the thing worked. It was easy to set up and didn't require materials that might be confiscated. I started getting more baseballs than ever. Fans always asked how I did it. Players often came over for a look. This is what they all wanted to know:</p>

<p><b>1)</b> The materials. Tie the string to the handle of your glove and keep it tucked away in the palm when you're not using it. It's a bit uncomfortable at first, but you'll get used to it.</p>

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/glovetrickmaterials.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/glovetrickmaterials.jpg','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/assets_c/2008/10/glovetrickmaterials-thumb-550x412.jpg" alt="glovetrickmaterials.jpg" class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" height="412" width="550" /></a></span><p><br />
<img alt="Blank_3" title="Blank_3" src="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/the_baseball_collector/images/blank_3.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border="0" height="55" width="550" /></p>

<p><b>2)</b> Hook the band under the flap on the outside of your glove's pocket. (If there's no flap, you have two choices: improvise or get a new glove.)</p>

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/glovetrickflap.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/glovetrickflap.jpg','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/assets_c/2008/10/glovetrickflap-thumb-550x412.jpg" alt="glovetrickflap.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="412" width="550" /></a></span><p><br />
<img alt="Blank_3" title="Blank_3" src="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/the_baseball_collector/images/blank_3.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border="0" height="55" width="550" /></p>

<p><b>3)</b> Stretch the band over the tip of your glove and prop the glove open with the Sharpie. (Without the Sharpie, the glove won't stay open. Normal pens don't work as well because they're thin and sometimes slip through the spaces between the fingers. When you have everything set up, the space between the band and the tip of the glove needs to be slightly smaller than the ball.)</p>

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/glovetrickassembled.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/glovetrickassembled.jpg','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/assets_c/2008/10/glovetrickassembled-thumb-550x412.jpg" alt="glovetrickassembled.jpg" class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" height="412" width="550" /></a></span><p><br />
<img alt="Blank_3" title="Blank_3" src="http://snaggingbaseballs.mlblogs.com/the_baseball_collector/images/blank_3.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" border="0" height="55" width="550" /></p>

<p><b>4)</b> Lower your glove over the ball. (At this point, you'll be dangling the glove by the string. I'm just holding the glove itself so I could take a decent pic. Anyway, the glove's weight forces the band to stretch around the ball. But first make sure that the band is not too tight or the ball won't go in, or too loose or the ball won't stay in. This takes practice.</p>

<p><b>5)</b> It's a delicate operation. Lift the glove slowly so the ball doesn't fall out. (This is the view from below, complete with the ceiling light in the hallway outside my apartment. Notice how the band has stretched back to hold the ball in place.)</p>

A few years ago, Rick Reilly named this trick the "ZackTrap" in a <a href="http://www.zackhample.com/baseball_collection/media/sports_illustrated.htm">story for Sports Illustrated</a>, and Rosie O'Donnell had me perform it live on her show. Good times, yes, but I've also gotten a few lectures along the way from stadium security. Some ballparks don't allow these kinds of contraptions, others have no problem with them, and a few have policies that fall somewhere in the middle. (For example, when I visited Oakland in <a href="http://www.zackhample.com/baseball_collection/lists/1999.htm">1999</a>, security allowed the fans to fish for balls behind the outfield walls, but wouldn't let us pluck them off the field.) It's hard to keep track of the rules, especially when they vary from one usher to the next, so be careful and respectful and ask for permission first. Oh, and don't tell anyone how the trick works. It's a secret.</p>

				            <p>Not if you do it right. You just have to wedge it in there, and then the pressure from the glove and rubber band should hold it in place. All I can say is: TRY IT.</p>

				            <p>Z,</p>

<p><br />
It was a good night at Ameriquest, 4 balls.  3 with the 'pickup' device, and one from Randy Messenger of the Marlins.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was a really boring snagging session.  There were lots of people, and it was one of those nights when if I left an area, boom, here comes a BP homer in the area I vacated.  Then I move again.  Hey look, right where I was a minute ago.</p>

<p></p>

<p>However, 4 balls is a solid day for me.  Later man.</p>

				            <p>Thanks for the happy recap, Dan. Sometimes, we're all gonna have frustrating days...but if we manage to plow through them with a few balls (or in this case four), then we have to feel pretty good.</p>

You're right. Often, that's all it takes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THOMAS-</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I'm lifting the glove back up, fans will reach out and try to grab the ball out of it...or just try to knock it loose so no one will get it. (Funny how that usually only happens at Yankee Stadium.) I've been in lots of altercations over the years. Mostly, people just get mad when I catch ball after ball after ball. I've had fans  intentionally shove me...even grab my glove and pull my arm down so I wouldn't have a chance to catch a ball...but I've never shoved back. That's not my style. (At Yankee Stadium, I'm too scared I'll get stabbed.)</p>

Sorry for the delayed reply. I didn't see your comment 'til now. The amount of string is really up to you, and it all depends on where you'll be using the trick. If your local ballpark has 10-foot walls, then you'll want at least 15 feet of string. If you think you might end up using the trick from much higher, attach a piece that's 30 feet long. You can always cut it if you have too much. I checked out the video clip. Good stuff, but it might've been even more impressive if you'd showed the string, or how high the glove was when it started its descent. Just a thought. Meanwhile, if your friend thinks I have "no life," perhaps he should find someone else more interesting to write about.</p>

<p>Thanks. I appreciate it. Just checked out your blog (for the first time) and left you a comment. I'm impressed. The whole thing is really well thought out and technologically savvy. I just wish it weren't all about the Yankees.    :-)</p>

				            <p>Hey thanks for the tip about the string, also I might be going to a couple games later this month at tht Rogers Centre against the White Soxs and the Devil Rays.  I was wondering if you know of anyone on those teams (coaches trainers etc.) that are known for giving out a lot of balls.</p>

<p><br />
Unfortunately, I haven't seen the Sox play in quite a while, so I really can't say anything about any of their players EXCEPT Thome, who's always been nice.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As for the Rays, your best bet is Jonny Gomes. Just last week at Yankee Stadium, he must've thrown 10 balls into the right field seats during a half-hour stretch of batting practice. Bullpen coach Bobby Ramos gives away a good amount of balls, too. Not sure about the rest of the guys. I don't make it to American League games too often...</p>

				            <p>Hey Zack I went to the Angels vs Jays game on sunday and it was a pretty good game Janssen was on fire and the Jays won.  I also got 2 balls first from who I think is the nicest guy on the Jays Scott Downs and the other one from Steve Soliz the bullpen catcher from the Angels.  I also would have gotten another one using the glove trick but my string got tangeled up.  However Janssen saw me and started to laugh and said he would give me a ball after he was done strectching except he took too long to stretch and eventually security made me move to my seats leaving me at 3 for the day.  Not bad for a game without Batting Practise.</p>

				            <p>Hey Zack,<br />
Was just wondering if you ever doing the glove trick and has your glove ever fell out on the field? And do you buy the cheapest tickets at the ball park or where do you sit. On Saturday, I went to a Phillies game against the Marlins and almost caught a ball in bp. We all cramed into the outfield and tried to get balls. I stood on a seat in the first row it was so deep. I did'nt get anything even when I called the players by there first names. So we went to the Phills dugout for autographs were it was cramed with people. We kept asking for balls and autographs, but the kid standing next to me wanted a ball to, so he was asking all the players like me. But since he did'nt know anything about baseball, he would pronouce thier names wrong, or call them by theier last names. Corey Lidle was going to come over but the kid was like, Lidel,Lidel, over here! I did'nt get anything but my brother got I BP ball, which was a real game ball. </p>

<p>I'll show you were we sat at CBP. (3 locations.)</p>

				            <p>Hey.</p>

<p><br />
I've had a couple scares with my glove while lowering it for the trick. One time at Yankee Stadium, way back in the early 90s, a security guard on the field yanked the glove out of my hand and snapped the string. He threatened to confiscate the glove, but ended up returning it after batting practice. Last year at Shea, my string got caught in some tiny gap in the left field wall, and I needed help from one of the players to untangle it. But that's about it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Usually, I buy the cheapest tickets and then move around, but sometimes, if there's a seat for sale in the PERFECT foul ball spot, I'll spring for it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sorry to hear you had such a tough time in Philly...but hey, it makes for a good story.</p>

As I've told other people above, SORRY for the delayed reply. Since this entry is so old, I don't check it as often to see if people have commented. But anyway, the best piece of advice I can give you is to read other old entries about the games I've attended. I talk about EVERYTHING I do to get balls, so that's really the best way to pick up lots of tips. Just make sure you attend batting practice and bring a glove, and remember that you can get lots of balls thrown to you by the players if you position yourself in the right spot and say the right things.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Awesome! I'm really glad to hear it. Did you try it at home or at a game?</p>

				            <p>Hey Zack! I'm 16 and my brother is 13 and we just bought your book on Amazon and love your tips and enthusiasm. We are going to a few games this season, and we are definitely trying the glove trick. We tested it a home and had to tape fishing weights around the webbing to get enough weight to capture the ball from our 15 ft. balcony. It works seamlessly now! We had the privilege of going to game 4 of the 08 World Series and snagged 4 balls during bp! Including a homer by Chris Coste just minutes after the gates opened. This was BEFORE we ever read your book! We didn't even have gloves! My Dad caught the homer with his bear hands! The rest we got with a fishing net that we snuck in a secret compartment in a backpack. I can't wait to test out your tips and tricks, and I will be sending updates tracking our success (pictures if you want). And we should have little trouble sneaking past security being our age! Any tips for Camden Yards during bp? I know there is a huge wall in right so I'm guessing left? We live in Central PA and go to many O's games. Thanks!</p>

				            <p>Hey Zack! I just went to a Braves game yesterday and got one ball in batting practice, but I should've gotten two if some middle aged man didn't push me out of the way.  But while I was there at Turner Field in batting practice, a home run ball was hit into the space between the wall and the seats.  So a guy rushes over and he has a device in his hand, it looks like a small version of the Libery Bell, but his is silver.  So he lowers it down, with the device's bottom landing right on top of the ball, and pulls it in!  Is this a newer device, because this guy gets the ball in about 5 seconds, and I didn't see any rubber bands or anything.  Do you know what I'm talking about, I'm trying to make one of these.  Congrats on all your baseballs Zack, and keep at it!</p>

Yeah, that basket is annoying.</p>

<p>MARKSHARK22-<br />
You're welcome. Glad to hear it.</p>

<p>RAYSFAN-<br />
Sorry for the very delayed reply. I don't even know what type of string I use. It's just...string...about a 16th of an inch thick. I wish I could tell you more.</p>

<p>KEEPER14-<br />
Apologies to you as well for the slow reply. Somehow I missed all of these comments until now. Very cool about Game 4 of the World Series. As for Camden Yards, you really can't go wrong at that place. Every section is fantastic for one reason or another.</p>

<p>SENNETTMATTHEW-<br />
Wow, a Liberty Bell? I wish I'd been there to see that.</p>

<p>ROYHOON-<br />
Thanks. You just have to be careful when you use it, but sometimes security won't even care. Some stadiums are cool like that.</p>

				            <p>Hi Zack, super old blog post I know but this inspired me years ago. Unfortunately that year i never got to attend a baseball game besides one in Oakland for a barbecue. But now, I'm building on my career total of 3 balls with an improvised device of my own based on the rubber band principle! (That and my trusty glove!) but my first ball was sooo long ago (i actually had JT Snow sign it, like 2 years after I caught it), and then I just so happened to get 2 batting practice balls this season alone! I'm off the Phillies @ Giant's game today, and I finally get to test my device. I just wanted to comment and let you know how i remember this blog from all those years ago! I'll post my trips outcome on my blog later but, until then THANK YOU FOR INSPIRING ME TO THIS DAY!</p>

				            <p>Zack -- I've been reading your blog for a while and finally got a chance to try to snag some MLB balls earlier this week, using the tips from your blog. (I live in Greensboro, NC, and took a 3-game trip to Atlanta.)  I decided to drop you a note on this blog entry since your glove trick is responsible for 5 of the 6 balls I snagged over 3 games. The sixth ball was obtained by asking the HP umpire for one after the game. Like you recommend, I politely asked him by name for one of the balls and he happily rolled it across the dugout top to me.</p>

<p>Living in Greensboro, I don't get the chance to make it out to many MLB games, so being able to easily snag some balls with the tips you write about it in your blog when I am able to go out makes the games even more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Thanks for cool blog. I'm looking forward to the new book when it comes out, and I'm looking forward to you having more time to go to games and snag balls, since your posts about snagging are so much fun to read!</p>

				            <p>Awesome. So glad to hear that the glove trick (AND ump trick) worked for you. Hey, since you live in Greensboro, if you ever pass by Jam's Deli on West Friendly Avenue (across from Guilford College), go in and tell the shaved-headed guys behind the counter that Zack Hample says hi. I think they'll still remember me. Anyway, thanks for this comment, and I hope you make it to some more games soon.</p>

				            <p>Thanks, Zack -- next time I'm over at Jam's, I'll be sure to tell the guys behind the counter you said hi. Using your glove and ump tricks really helped build my confidence for getting balls at games. I've been demonstrating the glove trick at the office ever since I got back from the games -- everyone's impressed. I'm hoping to hit a couple of series in Atlanta next year, and maybe even a series or two in Baltimore and/or DC. It's all sorts of fun.</p>
