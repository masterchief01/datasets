<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/12/garlic-butter-roasted-mushrooms/" title="mushrooms in garlic caper butter"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5126/5248534315_8ea3d1753e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="mushrooms in garlic caper butter" /></a></p>
A repeat offender in the lede-burier category, let me begin with what matters: this is absolutely my new favorite quick and obsessively delicious way to prepare mushrooms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5249119826/" title="little browns"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5284/5249119826_835bef230b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="little browns" /></a></p>
<p>And now, a story. Once upon a time, I was a vegetarian who loved going to steakhouses. A friends birthday would approach and out of kindness to me, they&#8217;d start talking about gathering friends at a restaurant that had vegetarian options and I&#8217;d beg them to go to a steakhouse instead. &#8220;It&#8217;s your birthday! I know you want a steak! You <i>deserve</i> a big fat juicy slab of steak,&#8221; I&#8217;d try to coerce. Why was I such a weirdo? Because good steakhouses have even better sides, and no matter how much the waiter sneered when I ordered them without a $50 centerpiece, I knew I&#8217;d be getting some flawlessly poached asparagus hollandaise and roasted potatoes like you wouldn&#8217;t believe. And mushrooms; I had broiled, buttery and garlicky mushroom caps at <a href="http://www.sparkssteakhouse.com/">Sparks</a> over a decade ago that I haven&#8217;t forgotten about since.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5248520817/" title="garlicked and buttered, ready to roast"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5129/5248520817_b9697ec055.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="garlicked and buttered, ready to roast" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-6986"></span></p>
<p>If only I knew the secret: escargot! No, I don&#8217;t mean that they were pulling some horsefat-in-the-vegetarian-French-fries kind of controversy, but more or less, they were giving the mushroom caps the escargot treatment, which is to say that they cooked them in a serious helping of garlic butter, zinged it with lemon juice and showered it with fresh flat leaf parsley and as any escargot lover will tell you, snails are great and all but really, it&#8217;s all about those puddles you scoop out with pieces of crusty baguette.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5248524321/" title="mushrooms, escargot-style"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5083/5248524321_93259d37dd.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="mushrooms, escargot-style" /></a></p>
<p>I found this recipe a while back on <a href="http://www.gourmet.com/recipes/2000s/2009/01/roasted-mushrooms">Gourmet.com</a>, something that hadn&#8217;t made the cut of what had to have been their final issue (moment of silence, but do you know what&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5252671513/">almost as wonderful</a>?). Seeing that that makes it nearly a year old, shame on me for not making these sooner. This is an incredible, quick side dish that will render everything else on the table second fiddle. But side dish, schmide dish, right? December is about cocktail parties and small plates, and I think these would fit right in. Get everything ready before guests arrive, pop them in the oven, pour the white wine and in 20 minutes, people will be lining up with their baguettes to get a swipe. Watch how fast humble little button mushrooms can disappear.</p>

<p><b>Garlic Butter Roasted Mushrooms</b><br />
Perfect as can be from <a href="http://www.gourmet.com/recipes/2000s/2009/01/roasted-mushrooms">Gourmet.com</a></p>
<p>1 pound mushrooms such as cremini or white, halved lengthwise if large<br />
2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and chopped<br />
3 large garlic cloves, minced<br />
2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br />
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces<br />
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice<br />
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 450&#176;F with rack in middle. Toss mushrooms with capers, garlic, oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a 1 1/2- to 2-qt shallow baking dish. Top with butter and roast, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and golden and bubbly garlic sauce forms below, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and parsley. Serve immediately, with crusty bread on the side for swiping up the juices.</p>

				<p>Mmmmm!  Have you ever been to the German Christmas Markets?  They have a dished that is basically stewed mushrooms topped with a garlic cream sauce (&#8216;knobelnach&#8217; I believe) and served with a piece of bread.  It&#8217;s delicious and it sounds a lot like your dish!</p>

				<p>Yes, another recipe that is doable and it is so true, I love escargot but it is not about the snail it is about the garlic butter, so this is brilliant&#8230;.and for me the uncoordinated, slacker cook, I CAN DO THIS!!! yeah!</p>

				<p>Comment #1 by Chad is right!<br />
Visiting a German Christmas Market means you are hit with various smells: Glühwein (mulled red wine), roasted German sausages, candied nuts and, yes, mushrooms. With a sauce on top that must be made with sour cream and lots of Knoblauch (garlic).<br />
The good stuff looks like yours. The not so good ones swim in unidentified broth.</p>
<p>I will be making yours soon! My father loves mushrooms but hates Christmas markets.</p>

				<p>When you say this is your new favorite way to prepare mushrooms, does that mean they&#8217;re better than your bourguignon recipe? Because as good as these look, that&#8217;s hard to believe :)</p>

				<p>So: totally missing the point here, I know, but could less butter be used to similar effect? These would be my mom&#8217;s favorite things ever, pretty much, but she&#8217;s been having medical issues that make it necessary for her to go way low-fat. If I halved the butter would things be too dry and sad?</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s so funny that you&#8217;re posting this recipe because I just made your mushroom and artichoke marsala pasta with cremini mushrooms last night! It turned out incredibly by the way. Luckily I can never get enough mushrooms so I&#8217;ll have to try this one as well! I made something similar over Thanksgiving based on a barefoot contessa recipe and it was a huge huge hit! Happy Holidays!</p>

				<p>This vegetarian loves going to steak houses too!  Somehow, they get the best potatoes in the city and they bake them just right.  And the mushrooms are truly divine.  All in all, a much better meal than I can get at many of Seattle&#8217;s more veg friendly places.</p>

				<p>I enjoy your blog immensely, but I have the proverbial stupid question.  When you say 3 large garlic cloves, do you mean the whole multi lobed head of garlic, or 3 broken out &#8220;mini bulbs&#8221;?  At the grocery store, I buy a clove of garlic and then get home and break a piece off, is that the clove or is the big bulb the clove?  I do not want to over garlic my guests.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I love that you bring that up about steakhouses!  While I am a meat eater and love a good steak, I think steakhouse sides are what bring me there.  Creamed spinach, lobster mac n&#8217; cheese, asparagus hollandaise (as you mention), scalloped potatoes, I could go on&#8230;I can&#8217;t wait to try this recipe!</p>

				<p>This looks fantastic! </p>
<p>When I first saw the photo I mistook the capers for puy lentils lurking at the bottom, but that would actually be a rather delicious way of turning this into a vegetarian main course (schmain course?).</p>

				<p>many years ago I worked for Victoria Station restaurants (long gone), famous for their prime rib. Mushrooms like these with lemon and garlic, were one of the best sides, and they were indeed amazing. I&#8217;ve never been able to recapture the flavor but I&#8217;m sure this recipe will do it. I believe Victoria Station sauteed theirs, but it makes sense to do it this way at home. Thank you!</p>

				<p>Mmm, I love roasted mushrooms, and these look so deliciously simple. One question though, do you think I could take out the capers without losing anything? I&#8217;m not a huge fan of them&#8230;I know they&#8217;re very salty, could I just add more salt? Sorry if this is an obvious question&#8230;</p>

				<p>@Ashley &#8211; I do mushrooms roasted with olive oil and white wine (and thyme etcetera) &#8211; this might be the alternative to butter you&#8217;re looking for? They still go soft and delicious with much less saturated fat. (Not that I have anything against butter!! I think I&#8217;d be banned from this website..)</p>

				<p>I would like some slivered red onions in here too please!  And maybe toss a handful of scallops in when you take them out of the oven too cook through.  Or sprinkle some manchego on top.  or serve on a bed of sauteed kale :)<br />
Or mince them when done, add to some flaky biscuit dough and make mushroom cakes.<br />
These look awesome as is too, thanks so much!</p>

				<p>Simply yummy!  I have the same Le Creuset baking dish ~~in yellow~~ that we refer to lovingly as the ovaal dish due to my sister&#8217;s pronunciation upon opening it at my bridal shower 25 years ago.  I am making this tomorrow.</p>

				<p>Laura &#8212; I bought it in June from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HSO1ZY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smitten-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001HSO1ZY" rel="nofollow">Le Creuset</a>. It&#8217;s surprisingly inexpensive (stoneware, not their enamelware). It&#8217;s a 1-quart. I actually did these mushrooms in two batches. I was so convinced that they couldn&#8217;t possibly be that exciting the way it was written, I only made half, then planned to make it &#8220;my way&#8221; the next time. They were so good, Jacob and mostly his mother ate almost all of them, and I made the second half to eat with dinner so my husband didn&#8217;t miss out.</p>

				<p>I go to steakhouses for the sides too, so you aren&#8217;t the only vegetarian (or ex-vegetarian) who does things like that. </p>
<p>@Ashley: If I did it without all the butter, I think I would use a quarter cup of marsala with a single tablespoon of butter. I will try it that way for the party I have this weekend. Lots of friends make great guinea pigs! I will try it that way and let you know.</p>

				<p>My first time commenting, although I&#8217;ve been an avid follower for some time (and frequently recommend the site to friends).  You have a knack for always coming up with just what I am looking for!  This looks delicious.  Any thoughts on how it would hold up if roasted and then set aside to be reheated after a short interval?  I am working on a menu for New Year&#8217;s Day that will have my (single) oven occupied and at a lower temperature.  Thanks for an ever inspiring site!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m sure I will be hated for saying this, but&#8230;<br />
Mushrooms! A great meat replacement option!<br />
As a vegetarian myself, I&#8217;ve come to find that mushrooms are a great stand-in for beef, especially when barbecuing with friends. I love putting a little balsamic vinegar on a portobello and using it like a hamburger patty.</p>

				<p>I have mushrooms in my kitchen right now.  Was planning to make a stroganoff with them, but will buy a baguette tomorrow and make this instead.  Sounds fabulous!  Bet any leftovers will be great with scrambled eggs, too.</p>

				<p>I totally agree with your point about escargots &#8211; ok, they are not bad, but the real reason to eat them is garlic, and butter. I think this is going to be my favourite way to give otherwise healthy mushrooms the thrill of real gluttony.</p>

				<p>Ok, so your last comment up there might be the answer to my question, Deb, but how many would you say this serves?  4 mushroom lovers; 6 otherwise?  I adore mushrooms so I feel very certain my husband and I could finish these off ourselves but here&#8217;s my scenario.  I need a quick (read: can be prepared after work before I have to get to a 6:30 potluck party) side dish for this week and this seems to fit the bill.  I could probably even just get to the house where I&#8217;m going a few minutes early and pop it in the oven there.  At this count there are going to be 14 women there.  Would you say double or triple the recipe?  Any thoughts?</p>

				<p>There is nothing like the smell of mushrooms, garlic and butter cooking.  For that alone making this dish would be worth it, but the bonus is the taste, mmm.  I&#8217;m off to save this recipe and then I may even feature it on my blog, giving credit where credit is due of course.   Then again, everyone reads your website so what would be the point, well, I&#8217;ll do it anyway, it is a way of recording recipes I have made and what I thought of them.</p>

				<p>Brooke &#8212; I think this would serve four mushroom lovers as a side dish. You could probably then serve it to 8 at a party, or more, depending on how much other stuff is out.</p>
<p>Brenda &#8212; For a neutral flavor. No reason you cannot swap it.</p>
<p>AJ &#8212; You can probably reheat it, if it hasn&#8217;t been too too long. Does this sound terrible? I might add a pat <i>extra</i> butter when reheating just to &#8230; you know, make sure nothing is lost.</p>

				<p>This is actually exactly how I make my roasted mushrooms, except I skip the capers and cut down on the butter and oil.  When I make them that way, the mushrooms are still tender and golden but a little less rich, which I prefer.  (I think I may have modeled my recipe on this Gourmet one, in fact.)  BTW, I am totally with you on the steakhouse thing.  If you&#8217;re ever in the Atlanta area, you need to go to Bone&#8217;s which has my favorite steakhouse mushrooms ever, with garlic, butter, and white wine, and a corn souffle that rocked my world.</p>

				<p>Your steakhouse comments made me chuckle.  My husband&#8217;s favorite restaurant is this old-school Italian steakhouse here in Chicago called Gene and Georgetti.  Like you, I also don&#8217;t eat steak, but I can&#8217;t wait for his birthday so I can go there and gorge on asparagus with hollandaise, lyonnaise potatoes and the most delicious, buttery, garlicy broiled mushrooms in the entire universe.  Can&#8217;t wait to try your version of one of my favorite dishes!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>Some people have made this without capers.  Do you think the capers are essential to the recipe?  I rarely cook with capers so I don&#8217;t even know if I like them!</p>

I just wanted to thank you for making this site. I ended up getting started cooking and even starting a little food blog while I was living in France because of you. Now I&#8217;m hooked.<br />
I still have alot to learn, but you and your site are a constant source of inspiration.<br />

				<p>Thank you very much for popularizing mushrooms. Many of my foreign friends associate my native Polish cuisine with mushrooms (mostly, wild mushrooms), which is probably true. While reading your recipe I realized that, since I started my blog in June, I have already posted three recipes with mushrooms as a main ingredient.</p>

How did I forget about that?!&#8221; I must have made that recipe 10 times last year. So I just pulled up the recipe and you posted it on this very day last year. Double awesome!</p>

				<p>Just made these with Baby Bella’s and they are absolutely delicious.  I didn&#8217;t have capers but wanted these mushrooms immediately, so I substituted scallions.  I can&#8217;t stop popping them in my mouth the sauce is so addicting.  Even my sister who hates mushrooms and thinks they were brought to earth by aliens commented that the house smells amazing.  Thank goodness she wouldn&#8217;t dare eat one, they&#8217;re all for me!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m making these tonight!  I love garlic and mushrooms, and at Spanish places LOVE the mushroom in olive oil/garlic/butter dish when done well.  Sadly, sometimes it isn&#8217;t done well &#8211; but with this idea (I suspect the capers and lemon/parsley are key to keep this from just being rich) I can do tapas at home.</p>

				<p>I am a mushroom addict, but the only one in my house who feels that way.  I can include them in small amounts in sauces and such, but hadn&#8217;t attempted a mushroom centered dish.  I made these last night, and my husband willingly ate them, and begrudginly admitted they were pretty tasty.  Thanks for an easy dish to add to my regular rotation!</p>

Last night I did a steakhouse-inspired meal using your creamed onions with bacon and chives as one of the sides and my husband mentioned several times that they were fantastic and should be made more often. I&#8217;ll have to give these a try next time (along with the creamed onions, of course!).</p>

				<p>Thank you! My craving for escargot at home has been filled without giving in to the canned snails I keep inspecting and poking at HEB. </p>
<p>Champagne, these mushrooms, bread and a salad have made two wonderful meals, and since it is the holidays and I am constantly cooking or preping for parties I haven&#8217;t had the energy to make dinner in a few days, so yay for easy homemade food.</p>

				<p>One of the joys of being a single, empty-nester is that I get to cook and eat what I like.  I think I&#8217;m going to like these very much!  I&#8217;m making bread today and I think these mushrooms with some bread and maybe a salad (even in this frigid weather) sound like dinner.</p>

				<p>What does &#8220;lede-burier&#8221; mean?  I googled it and kept getting sent back to your site&#8211;you&#8217;re just too popular!  I checked through the other comments, but since there&#8217;s 200 of them I might have missed it if this has already been answered.  Please help!</p>

				<p>These are wonderful! I made them last night, but halved the recipe because I was only cooking for myself. I am also not the mushroom&#8217;s #1 fan, but thought I&#8217;d give it a try.</p>
<p>I now seriously regret not having made the entire recipe because I could be enjoying leftovers for lunch right now&#8230; if they&#8217;d survived that long.</p>

				<p>I made these a couple of nights ago and they were, indeed, tasty.  Mine, however, did not develop that beautiful brownish roasted-glaze so wonderfully decpicted in the photos accompanying the recipe.  I had considered using a basalmic glaze and maybe putting them under the broiler for a few minutes when I realized that the look was off but didn&#8217;t want to tinker too much.  I used a brush (not water) to clean the mushrooms and was faithful to the suggested quantities of butter and oil.  I ended up with a lot of juice and little browning.  Still, good eats!  Man, mushrooms at my grocery were $2.49 for 8 oz &#8211; should have gone down the road to the store that always has older stock marked down!</p>

				<p>dlynn &#8212; Yeah, it&#8217;s not an exhaustive category. For things like side dishes, most don&#8217;t have flour anyway. I&#8217;ve been trying to use it to tag recipes where you might expect to find gluten but it&#8217;s not there. But perhaps I should reconsider?</p>
<p>Bette &#8212; We (as in, Jacob and I) are big fans of the Canal House cookbooks. If you know anyone who loves cooking, I cannot recommend a year of them enough as a gift. (It&#8217;s how I came to know them!)</p>
<p>Carrie &#8212; I loved the capers in them but I firmly believe that most recipes benefit from a little acidity. That said, I am sure they will still be tasty without them.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Burying the lede&#8221; is a journalism term for hiding the main point of the story further down the page. In a newspaper article, it should be the first paragraph. I was giving myself a hard time over always using a &#8220;This happened. And then<em> this other thing</em> happened! And it led to&#8230; [insert dish of the day]!&#8221; structure we often use in food blogs, so rather than delving right into a backstory, I decided to try starting with the main point: these are great and <i>then</i> tell you what led up to it.</p>
<p>Oh goodness, that was a long and boring explanation. Aren&#8217;t you glad you asked?</p>

				<p>I made these and loved them so, so much. Surprisingly, I had some left over (it was only me and the husband) so to use up the rest, I chopped the leftovers up and encased them in some phyllo dough. It was the best idea I&#8217;ve ever had. Sort of like hand pies. Yum.</p>

But next time I&#8217;d add the lemon and parsley back in.  They were very very tasty.  Will be making this for our holiday party, to raves I&#8217;m sure.</p>

I used whole baby bella mushrooms sliced cremini.  My son hasn&#8217;t been a huge mushroom fan &#8212; but I actually saw him licking the bowl.  Glad he only does that I home&#8230; I hope.

				<p>These were delicious.  Made them for dinner tonight.  We had white, crimini and fresh shitake in the refrigerator.  Had more mushrooms than was called for so I slightly upped the other ingredients with the exception of the garlic.  only used 2 cloves (and we LOVE garlic) but still found it to be a little too much. But still was great &#8211; minor quibble &#8211; and it could be our garlic &#8211; some heads are more pungent than others.</p>
<p>Served it with polenta spiked with some goat cheese and steamed kale.  Oh and a sourdough baguette for dipping all those great juices.</p>

				<p>I made this the other day with cremini and oyster mushrooms. My husband and I polished off 1.5 lbs and I think I used about 4 cloves of garlic. The goodness-to-effort ratio is amazing! </p>
<p>To the caper fearers I say go for it—they really meld into the whole—you just want some salty brightness. I was thinking you could use anchovies instead, but if you don&#8217;t like capers, you probably hate anchovies. Now I&#8217;m thinking about pizza. This would be a great pizza topping.</p>

				<p>These looked awesome, so I made them, then pulsed them in the food processor and stuffed a whole slew of homemade ravioli. (Perhaps snuck a few as a snack while working). Served my mushroom ravs in a tomato-mushroom broth with a little grated parmesan.  Really really good &#8211; wouldn&#8217;t have thought of it without this delicious recipe and those beautiful photos.</p>

				<p>Made these the other night when guests were over. They received raves, and I agree they were great, but I might take a page from your mushroom/leek quiche recipe and add some port to it next time to mellow out the acidity of the capers. The capers did add a nice zing, but Julia Child  knew what she was doing when she poured port on  fungi &#8212; and I think these could benefit a bit, too.</p>

				<p>I made these last week for my boyfriend&#8217;s family.  Since no one &#8220;likes mushrooms&#8221; I decided not to double the recipe.  Those mushroom haters ate them all before dinner was ready.  The best part was how easy they were to make; it felt like cheating.</p>

				<p>I made these last night with pork chops.  So delicious!  This is basically the base for my husband&#8217;s and my favorite appetizer served at a local family of restaurants.  It&#8217;s called Almost Escargot.  Each well of the escargot dish has a mushroom cap surrounded by wonderful herbed garlic butter, then the whole dish is smothered with bernaise and what I think is gruyere and baked or broiled to perfection.  It is served with lemon wedges, puff pastry squares and chunks of crusty bread.  It is absolutely heavenly.  This was a great at home version with some of the same flavor.  My mushrooms did not brown, however, like your beautiful picture, and produced much more juice.  Perhaps from adding the salt upfront?  Love this site!</p>

				<p>It was just my husband and me for Christmas; I made salmon en croute, Bobby Flay&#8217;s roasted brussel sprouts, and these mushrooms. Sadly, I ate the mushrooms last. I immediately regretted eating anything else on my plate. I seriously cannot wait to be hungry again and eat the leftovers!</p>

				<p>I may have to make these soon. They look to die for! I love mushrooms and could easily eat them every day, so I&#8217;m always interested in new ways to cook them. I just made delicious lentil mushroom pot pies last night and have the recipe on my blog. Also another way to indulge in some hearty mushroom goodness!</p>

				<p>We were planning on having steak on Christmas anyway, so I emailed this recipe to my husband. He made it, and we ate it On Christmas day. Then we ate it again the day after Christmas. Yesterday, we went out and bought four more packs of mushrooms. This may be a bad thing. (at least we&#8217;re not overloading on sweets?)</p>

				<p>I made these as a side dish for Christmas dinner, drawn in by how ridiculously simple it was mostly and how, considering the ingredients, one could not go wrong. And you can&#8217;t! I forgot to add butter from the beginning, so I just added it when they were done and just keeping warm in the oven. Fab dish. Probably even better with a teeny tiny bit less salt (ho-hum, silly me minced the garlic in salt, y&#8217;see, then salted anyway) and butter from the start. I&#8217;ll be making again.</p>

				<p>YUM. You would think immediately it&#8217;s the garlic and butter that make this amazing &#8211; and it&#8217;s true, they are always great conspirators. But I gotta say: I think it&#8217;s the lemon that really made this dish sing. Thanks for an easy dish that gives the illusion that I can actually cook.</p>

				<p>We hosted my stepmother&#8217;s Italian family for Christmas this year and she asked me to do two side dishes &#8211; including a mushroom dish.  Now, I don&#8217;t much like mushrooms, but I love capers, love garlic and LOVE escargot.  Of course I made this and of course I was the one sitting at the table dipping my bread in the juices&#8230; and of course two of my aunts asked for the recipe immediately.  Thanks for another wonderful recipe from your beautiful blog!</p>

My husband declared them the &#8220;best&#8221; mushrooms he&#8217;s had.  This will definitely be in the rotation &#8211; I think I may try adding Balsamic vinegar next time.

				<p>Yes, yes, yes! This was so great, it&#8217;s like flash-marinating the mushrooms and roasting them at the same time. So flavorful! Two of us split the full recipe as an entree with a couple ciabatta rolls, simplest meal we&#8217;ve made in a long time.</p>

				<p>I made these mushrooms yesterday, and think I will be making them again tonight. I love mushrooms, garlic and parsley and have several variations on that theme (adding som cured ham is very nice too), but the capers are an unexpected and very welcome addition to my repertoire :-) Thank you!</p>

				<p>I made these for dinner and loved them! When I baked them I just used a metal pan that I had. I don&#8217;t like capers, which i weird since I am Italian. I used black olives instead. I also pured a little bit of the olive juice in. They came out declicious. I wan&#8217;t wait to make them again Next I am thinking with some sauted chicken and pasta this will be great.</p>

				<p>You must get this all the time, but I can&#8217;t stop reading your blog! I&#8217;m recently married and I keep telling my husband that my job I currently have is interfering with my potential to live up to my full house wife potential. All I want to do is cook! (not to mention eat the things I cook..)<br />
Thank you for providing me with amazing recipes I can experiment with on my next couple of days off. :)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this recipe twice. I can say that the crimini mushrooms make a much better choice than white button mushrooms.  Also, the recipe omits salt, which I feel it definitely needs.  I also cut the lemon juice down to about 1/8 of a medium size lemon, which I also liked better than the first time.</p>
<p>That being said, it is a fantastic recipe, and I&#8217;m adding this to my routine.</p>
<p>@Quyen &#8211; I think that&#8217;s the point, the large amount of liquid is the deliciousness that you mop up with a good baguette.</p>

				<p>I made these last night as part of a small and quickly put together vegetarian dinner party (served with fresh bread, a salad of grated carrot, beetroot, spinach and feta, and a warm salad of roasted broccolli and sweet potato with parmesan and avocado &#8211; it all sounds weird but worked).</p>
<p>So delicious! Will be making them again in a hurry, especially because I forgot to squeeze in lemon at the end *facepalm* and I&#8217;d like to try it with a dash of white wine and maybe shallots, like other people have suggested. For those caper-haters wondering if they should leave them out or not, can I suggest halving the amount? That was all I had (I&#8217;ll use more next time) and there was no strong caper taste, they were just melty and delicious, and added something extra to it.</p>

				<p>Made these tonight and my only regret was that I didn&#8217;t double the recipe.  Make sure to cut large mushrooms in half or quarters and to reduce the sauce enough.  The mushrooms can stay in the oven and still end up good if the sauce is not thick enough by 20 minutes.  I also found that it was necessary to salt the dish to taste. Great dish as a side or entree.</p>

I love all your dishes. Every time I make this for someone, they are blown away by the flavors, I have a new love for capers now! Also just wanted to let you know I made this last night with spaghetti noodles, a little less butter and more olive oil and some onions, and it was delicious! Thanks for the inspiration and all the amazing recipes!</p>

				<p>It is delicious!</p>
<p>I used oyster mushrooms, baby portobello and champignon de Paris. Also added a bit of green onions, and&#8230; escargots. Just thought it would go perfectly with it, and it does! Added a bit of parmesan cheese on top and some fleur de sel, and I am eating it right now with warm ciabatta bread.</p>

				<p>This dish was recommended to me by a co-worker (the same co-worker that put me on to your site!).  I love capers, so capers, butter, garlic and mushrooms?  A no-brainer.  The only problem is that because they are roasting at 450, this goes in last and you are waiting for this to be done while the rest of dinner is ready, however because you serve these immediately (they cool off quickly) it all comes together nicely!  Sounds so fancy, but is really basic to make&#8230;the best kind of recipe.</p>

				<p>Deb &#8211; What do you think about preparing these on the stove top in a cast iron skillet with a lid?  I made them last year and LOVED them, but am also thinking of how to save on oven space.  Do you think that if the cooking vessel is heavy enough it would keep them from burning??</p>

				<p>Huge fan of you blog !This recipe reminded of what my mama makes too.<br />
My Mom makes these amazing mushrooms along the same lines.<br />
We saute some crushed garlic with a dollop of butter in a think pan. When the garlic turns golden brown , add mushrooms and saute. Sprinkle some pepper and salt. Just when the mushrooms are done , add some cream/milk.</p>
