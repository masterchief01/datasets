		<h3><a href="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2012/brandy-old-fashioned/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Brandy Old Fashioned">Brandy Old Fashioned</a></h3>
	<p><img src="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crw_0637doctored.jpg" alt="Wisconsin-stye Brandy Old Fashioned" title="Brandy Old Fashioned" width="350" height="233" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2047" /></p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the greatest triumphs of the cocktail renaissance is the <a href="http://oldfashioned101.com/">rediscovery of the classic Old Fashioned</a>. I’ve often spoken of how at some point after the repeal of Prohibition, the <strong>Old Fashioned</strong> became lost and possibly confused with a long-forgotten drink called a <strong>Smash</strong> (basically a tarted-up <strong>Mint Julep</strong> covered in fruit), a mere husk of its former, glorious self.</p>
<p>For decades, bartenders just like me served a limp, weak concoction consisting of a half-muddled sugar cube, a mashed-up neon red cherry and orange, a splash of whiskey, and some soda water drowning the results.</p>
<p>With a little luck, and a lot of hard work, that&#8217;s all changed with the renewed interest in classic cocktails. Now at any given night at my bar you can find literally a dozen people sipping on two ounces bourbon touched with a teaspoon of sugar and two dashes of bitters, garnished with a simple orange twist over a couple big ice cubes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>But don’t try to pull that bullshit with the good people of the Great State of Wisconsin</strong>, where the <strong>Brandy Old Fashioned</strong> rules supreme. It’s not the same drink as above, it just shares a name. And if you make it right, really right, it’s a damn delicious cocktail and worthy of examination.</p>
<p>Being located in a hotel, we’re used to serving folks from all over the world. And the first time I witnessed a guest from Wisconsin stare blankly as one of my bartenders handed over two ounces of Cognac touched with a teaspoon of sugar and two dashes of bitters and garnished with a simple orange twist over a couple big ice cubes, I knew some further training was in order.</p>
<p>So in the name of making cocktails &#8211; all cocktails &#8211; with as much of our hearts as we can offer, I present to you what I believe to be the perfect <strong>Brandy Old Fashioned</strong>&#8230; <em>Wisconsin-style</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I start with an old fashioned glass I’ve chilled in the freezer. Call it a tumbler, call it a double rocks glass, or call it a bucket, it’s a glass you’re familiar with.  To that I add two dashes of Angostura bitters and a teaspoon of sugar. If I’m in a hurry I use a 2:1 simple syrup, but if I’m going to spend some time, I use a sugar cube. The sugar cube is preferable here because it’s going to add some friction to the muddling we’re about to do. <em>Brace yourselves, cocktail &#8220;nerds&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crw_0616doctored1.jpg" alt="" title="Getting an orange wedge and cherry ready to muddle with sugar and bitters" width="350" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2038" /></p>
<p>Next I’ll take a thick-cut orange wedge, and a cherry. The usual suspect here is a grocery store maraschino cherry, but I always choose a brandied Amarena cherry. Remember, you’re going to get out what you put in, so a quality cherry is going to make the drink that much better.</p>
<p>I muddle the sugar, bitters, orange wedge and cherry into a thick paste, careful not to touch the orange peel too much as it’ll bring unwanted bitterness to the party &#8211; just work around the peel and pulverize that orange meat. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crw_0621doctored.jpg" alt="After muddling, the ingredients should form a sort of thick, fruit paste" title="Muddled fruit" width="350" height="350" class="size-full wp-image-2039" /></p>
<p>Your standard <strong>Brandy Old Fashioned</strong> brandy of choice is <strong>Korbel</strong>: cheap California brandy. Considering the <em>hundreds of thousands of cases</em> they ship to Wisconsin every year, it might be considered sacrosanct to use anything else. But if you want to do this right, really right, then do yourself a favor and use some good Cognac. I have my preferred brandy, you have yours.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crw_0626doctored.jpg" alt="" title="Pierre Ferrand Cognac" width="350" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2040" /></p>
<p>At this point your typical Wisconsinite barkeep is going to add ice and finish the drink in one of two main ways: <strong>sweet</strong> or <strong>sour</strong>. Those who take it sweet will ask for a splash of Sprite or 7-Up, those who take it sour get a dose of Collins Mix or Squirt. To me, it’s just a way of watering down the drink, so I leave out the soda and take a more&#8230; cocktail-y method.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crw_0637doctored_1.jpg" alt="" title="Brandy Old Fashioned" width="350" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2044" /></p>
<p>Crushed ice is a must for me whenever I whip up a Brandy Old Fashioned. I always skip the soda and let the tiny shards of ice do the work, taming those strong, sweet flavors and turning this into a drink you can sip slowly.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crw_0635doctored.jpg" alt="Brandy Old Fashioned" title="The Brandy Old Fashioned" width="350" height="525" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2041" /></p>
<p>As for a garnish, most will throw a “flag” of an orange wedge and a cherry spiked through with a wooden toothpick, but my take here is that those things are already in the drink, so I skip ‘em. Besides, how pretty does that look <strong>without</strong> the goofy fruit salad perched over the top?</p>
<p>You know, it’s something to enjoy sipping on while you cook up some bratwurst and onions in a boiling kettle of beer before everyone comes over to watch the Packers game. Drink accordingly.</p>
<h2>Brandy Old Fashioned</h2>
<blockquote><p>1 sugar cube or 1 tsp 2:1 simple syrup<br />
2 dashes Angostura bitters<br />
1 orange wedge<br />
1 cherry, preferably Amarena or Maraska<br />
2 oz brandy or Cognac</p></blockquote>
<p>In a chilled old fashioned glass, muddle the sugar, bitters, orange wedge and cherry into a thick paste, careful not to work the orange peel. Add brandy or Cognac, stir, and fill glass with crushed ice and serve.</p>

<p>A side project, an experiment or just a simple curiosity that turned into a delicious phenomenon that we're still serving to much delight at our bar, barrel aged cocktails explore the gentle manipulation of a drink's flavors over time. This post details the inspiration, the history and the methods behind my barrel aged cocktails.</p>

<p>My problem with homemade tonic water has always been a flavor profile that was too esoteric for the general audience. This recipe takes some of the positive qualities people have come to understand from commercial tonic water and updated them with fresh ingredients.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2009/egg-nog/" title="Egg Nog&nbsp;&raquo;">Egg Nog</a></h3>

<p>Turned off by the glop you find in the grocery store, and unable to endure another long egg and cream whipping session, I set out to build an egg nog recipe from the ground up that retained the character of the orginal formula, was easy to make in a few minutes at home or at the bar, and tasted absolutely delicious.  See if you agree with the result.</p>

<p>One question I'm often asked is "Do you have any drink-related book recommendations?"  Well, funny you should ask, I've compiled a list of the ten books every professional bartender or home mixologist should own.  I keep every one of these close at hand and have read most of them several times.  I suggest you do the same.</p>

<p>The problem with living in Oregon is the absence of little wooden shacks by the sea that sell cases of fresh ginger beer stacked on back porches. But with some readily-available ingredients, a recipe I've been revising for several years - and a few free minutes - I can easily transport myself to a little fishing boat on the ocean as I sip a <strong>Dark and Stormy</strong> made with fresh, house-made ginger beer.</p>

<p>It's always mojito season somewhere, so this advice is timely in your area about half the year.  Wether you're making them or simply enjoying them, this advice will help you look like a pro in no time at all.</p>

<p>The flavors of the Richmond Gimlet are imbued with sunshine.  Fresh mint mingling with the herbaceousness of gin and the tartness of lime have made this drink a Eugene classic for many years now.</p>

<p>Not to be confused with the Spanish wine-and-fruit-based alcoholic beverage sangria, sangrita (meaning "little blood") is a traditional accompaniment to a tequila served completo; a non-alcoholic sipper that cleanses the palate between fiery doses of agave.</p>

<p>The world of booze can be mystifying to people that don't work in bars or around alcohol all the time. I hear a lot of assumptions about the industry I'm in that are - much like 90% of what you hear in bars - completely false. Here are a few you've probably heard yourself.</p>

<p>The traditional garnish for a Pisco Sour is a couple of drops of bitters in the foam, but I've never been particularly impressed with the way these few paltry drops of bitters sat in their little egg-white mattress and didn't play along with the rest of the drink. I envisioned a Pisco Sour with a uniformly-distributed bitters-scorched foam: slightly crisp as the fire burnt the sugars, and slightly warm as the foam insulated the rest of the frosty cocktail from the heat. <em>A pisco creme brul&eacute;e in a glass!</em></p>

<h2 class="aboutme"><span>About Me</span></h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Jeff Morgenthaler</strong> and I'm the bar manager at <a href="http://www.clydecommon.com/">Clyde Common</a> in <strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>.

<p><img src="http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/wp-content/themes/morgenthaler/images/morgenthaler.jpg" alt="A photo of me behind the bar." style="text-align: center;"/></p>

<p>I've been tending bar since 1996 and writing about it since 2004.  I started tending bar while getting my degree in Interior Architecture, and slowly I came to the conclusion that bartending was what I really loved, and that I might as well drop everything and focus on being a professional bartender. Over the years I have strived, both behind the bar and with this website, to elevate the experience of having a drink from something mundane to something more culinary.</p>

<p>The writing I do here is intended as a work in progress.  My recipes are like my opinions: they are constantly being revised and refined as I work them through my mind and my fingers.  Comments and participation are encouraged, so please don't feel the need to tread lightly here.</p>

<h3>Step One: The Header.</h3>
<p>I see a lot of resumes in my position, and you&#8217;d be surprised at just how many people leave resumes with no contact information.  First, print your name in large letters.  Don&#8217;t forget your mailing address (if different from your home address, always use the mailing address), phone number, and email address.</p>
<div class="resumexample">

/* ]]> */
</script></h4>
</p></div>
<p>You want to give employers a clear way to get in touch with you, otherwise, what would be the point of having a resume?</p>
<h3>Step Two:  Skip the Objective.</h3>
<p>For some reason, it&#8217;s been traditional to include an <strong>objective</strong> section in a resume, and I&#8217;ve never understood why.  Everyone&#8217;s objective is the same: to secure a good job.  No matter how you dress it up&#8230;</p>
<div class="resumexample">
<h3 style="text-decoration: line-through;">Objective</h3>
<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">To find employment in a fast-paced, fun work environment.</p>
</p></div>
<p>&#8230;it always comes off sounding weak.  Skip it.</p>
<h3>Step Three: Languages and Special Skills</h3>
<p>Believe me, if you speak a foreign language, especially Spanish, in a restaurant in this country, you&#8217;re going to be one step ahead of the game.  Put it down, but don&#8217;t lie about it.  If you can only count to ten in Arabic, it&#8217;s not worth mentioning.  </p>
<p>Do you have any computer skills?  I&#8217;m talking about POS (Point of Sale) systems here.  Squirrel, Micros, Aloha, etc.  If you&#8217;ve used a computer system at another job, put it down.  More and more establishments are moving to computer systems, and having to spend two days training you how to punch in an order is only going to be a deterrent to hiring you.</p>
<div class="resumexample">
<h2>How I Communicate</h2>
<h3>In The Real World..</h3>
<p>I can read and write in French.  Asking me to speak it may require a freshen-up trip to Paris.</p>
<h3>&#8230;On A Computer</h3>
<p>I can program a Micros point-of-sale system, and I have four years of experience with Squirrel. I speak Microsoft Windows and Macintosh with equal proficiency.  I have a firm grasp on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00337D8U6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=jeffremorgen-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B00337D8U6">Microsoft Office Suite</a>, the Adobe Creative Suite, and the Macromedia Suite. I am skilled in web page design, XHTML and CSS.</p>
</p></div>
<p>On a side note, I received a resume a few weeks ago and the applicant put down that he was proficient with both Internet Explorer and Firefox.  I almost had a stroke from laughing as I slid the resume into the trash.</p>
<h3>Step Four: Education.</h3>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s just a foodservice job.  No, you don&#8217;t need a PhD to do it.  But having some education shows that you&#8217;re a little more well-rounded than other applicants.  And hey, you spent $30,000 on that philosophy degree, so get some mileage out of it!</p>
<div class="resumexample">
<h2>My Formal Education</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.hartnell.cc.ca.us/">Hartnell College</a></h3>
<h4>1989 &#8211; 1992</h4>
<h4>Salinas, California</h4>
<p>Graduated with A.S. degree in physics.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.bme.hu/">Technical University of Budapest</a></h3>
<h4>1991</h4>
<h4>Budapest, Hungary</h4>
<p>Studied Hungarian baroque architecture as part of the <strong>Boronda Art Scholarship</strong> awarded through <a href="http://www.hartnell.cc.ca.us/">Hartnell College</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a></h3>
<h4>1992 &#8211; 1998</h4>
<h4>Eugene, Oregon</h4>

</p></div>
<p>Also worth mentioning here is any special training or bar-/restaurant-related coursework.  If you took a class on wine, mention it here.  If you went to bartending school, put it down.  Spend some time on this section.  It&#8217;s almost as important as the following section.</p>
<h3>Part Five: Work Experience.</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the meat of your resume.  Now, I get a lot of people asking how to fill in this section when they don&#8217;t have any bartending experience.  It&#8217;s very simple: you lie.  Just kidding.  Always tell the truth, even if it is a bit embellished.  I&#8217;ve actually hired people with &#8220;some&#8221; bartending experience only to find out that they lied about having any, and they were subsequently fired.  Now I have a test that I have all my new applicants take.</p>
<p><strong>Important tip:</strong> When you&#8217;re filling out the job description for each establishment you&#8217;ve worked in, I feel that it&#8217;s more important to convey a sense of what sort of place it was, rather than recounting what you did there.  Face it, you did the same thing at every job: served customers, worked the cash register, and cleaned.  I don&#8217;t care.  What I want to know as a bar manager is what sort of establishment you worked in, as I haven&#8217;t had the chance to visit every bar and restaurant in the country.  Was it a dive bar?  Fine dining?  Nightclub?  Let me know.  Some of us in fine dining are actually looking for people who come up from high-volume chain restaurants.  You never know, so dont&#8217; be shy, and do be as specific as possible.</p>
<div class="resumexample">
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>El Vaquero</h3>
<h4>2005 &#8211; 2007</h4>
<h4>296 East Fifth Avenue<br />
        Eugene, Oregon</h4>
<p>Head bartender. Tapas and Steaks.  Huge menu and an enormous Spanish wine list, complemented by my menu of classic cocktails &#8211; with a twist.  Priced OLCC catalog, set up Micros POS, trained a hardworking staff of bartenders, barbacks and cocktail servers, and conducted liquor classes for the staff of two restaurants.  Fast-paced atmosphere, Disco Night on Thursdays, and a very demanding thirtysomething clientele.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.marcherestaurant.com/">Marche</a></h3>
<h4>2001 &#8211; 2005</h4>
<h4>296 East Fifth Avenue<br />Eugene, Oregon</h4>
<p>Bartender/waiter. Buttoned-up black-tie service for the pre-theater crowd. Northwest cuisine done in the French bistro tradition, washed down with bottles of Pinot Noir. Huge French and Pacific Northwest wine list, dessert crowd at ten, open kitchen and bistro-style zinc-topped bar.</p>
<h3>Chanterelle</h3>
<h4>2002</h4>
<h4>207 East Fifth Avenue #109<br />
        Eugene, Oregon</h4>
<p>Bartender. Full-service, fine continental restaurant. Early crowd, small kitchen, tough German chef, fast pace.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.macsatvet.com/">The Vet&#8217;s Club</a></h3>
<h4>2000</h4>
<h4>1626 Willamette Street<br />
        Eugene, Oregon</h4>
<p>Bartender. Huge thirty-five seat bar, and the hottest club in town. Late nights, stiff drinks, intense fast pace, two bartenders and a lot of smoky blues.</p>
<h3>The Tiny Tavern</h3>
<h4>1996 &#8211; 2000</h4>
<h4>394 Blair Boulevard<br />
        Eugene, Oregon</h4>
<p>My first bartending job. Four years, five nights a week in one of the toughest bars in town. Famous chili, pitchers of Olympia, loud music and a lot of smoke.</p>
</div>
<p>You should list any work experience you have here.  The more food- or bar-related experience you can list, even if it&#8217;s as a barista or prep cook, the better.</p>
<h3>Part Six: References.</h3>
<p>I prefer not to list references on my resume (especially on the web, I don&#8217;t need people calling my former bosses at six in the morning) because I have a lot of experience here in town.  However, if you&#8217;re applying for a job in another city, or if you don&#8217;t have a lot of experience, then you might want to list work-related references.  Keep it under three, kid.</p>
<p>I hope this tutorial has helped, and that you&#8217;re now on your way to writing a successful resume.  If you&#8217;re looking for more advice and/or some professional help with your bar resume, my friends <a href="http://www.misscharming.com/bartender/bartenderresume.html">Cheryl Charming</a> and <a href="http://www.theartofdrink.com/blog/2007/01/bartenders-resume.php">Darcy O&#8217;Neil</a> have posted additional information at their own sites.</p>

			<p><p>I am finding it very hard to find a bartending gig. It is definitely a job to get experience, experience to get a job situation. I have worked as a barback, and got that down. I want to move onto bartending now. I took a course, but people don&#8217;t seem to consider that experience. It seems like lying is my only way to get a gig. What do you suggest?</p>

			<p><p>Good post!!! Just one thing though, you didn&#8217;t actually say what would you like to see in an inexperienced bartender&#8217;s resume with mixology schooling. Does this mean you suggest lying?</p>

			<p><p>Thanks!  I don&#8217;t suggest lying, in any area.  Here&#8217;s what I do suggest:</p>
<p>Put your mixology schooling in under the education heading, and summarize what you took from the course.</p>

			<p><p>Hello Jefferey,</p>
<p>Above, you said martini background on resume (to LisaMarie) is absolutely not professional, but yet you suggest Cheryl Charming&#8217;s site, which she use it religiously. Still no? Just a little confused. </p>
<p>And there&#8217;s certain bars I want to apply, but bartending school being my only experience, they prefer one w/ years of experience. Would you suggest it&#8217;s a good idea if I offer to work w/ no pay for a week to prove I&#8217;m good?</p>

			<p><p>I&#8217;ve noticed that you give a different sort of advice than people who want me to hire them to write a resumé for me.</p>

			<p><p>Keep pumping the pump for a good gig. If you have no job, take any job you can &amp; keep looking.</p>
<p>If you already have a job, you are lucky, because you can slowly single out a better one.</p>
<p>Submit resumes in person to hiring manager. APPEARANCE is everything in our business.</p>
<p>Put a photo on your resume.</p>
<p>Be genuinely interested during the interview &amp; ask alot of questions &amp; write down the answers in front of the interviewer.</p>
<p>Ask them &#8216;trap&#8217; questions like: &#8220;What are you looking for in your next bartender&#8221;??</p>
<p>After they respond say: &#8216;Well look no further because I am that person&#8221;.</p>
<p>SHOW A LOT OF CONFIDENCE.</p>

			<p><p>Jeff &#8211; this was extremely helpful, but I have some questions that weren&#8217;t already answered here.  Is a photo on the resume actually helpful?  Will it keep you fresh in the hiring manager&#8217;s mind, or will it seem tacky?  Also, would you submit a resume for a barbacking or cocktailing gig, or does that seem like you&#8217;re getting a little ahead of yourself?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for all of the wonderful information you&#8217;ve provided so far!</p>

			<p><p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, Tori and Andrew.  We always kind of laugh at the resumes that have photos on them, but maybe my friends and I are just pricks.</p>
<p>Confidence aside, I just think it looks tacky.  But if you&#8217;re applying for a job at TGI Friday&#8217;s, then by all means, drop a photo on there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what you mean by getting ahead of yourself by submitting a resume for a barbacking or cocktailing gig, I think a resume is always an appropriate and professional gesture.</p>

			<p><p>No it&#8217;s not tacky, at all.</p>
<p>If you are hideous looking then just don&#8217;t do it. The hospitality/food &amp; beverage business is an appearance based business. The hottest bars have the hottest bartenders.</p>
<p>I look good and my photo resume gets me noticed. Listen, I would never apply at TGI Fridays, that&#8217;s not my style of place. I think you should edit &amp; rewrite that suttle/hidden insult.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A PRETTY GIRL and you put your small photo onto a resume, then you will get noticed PERIOD. You will get the interview over the 25 others who just filled out an application only.</p>
<p>The owners who I speak with say &#8216;I like your approach, we just toss the paperwork from the other clowns away&#8217;</p>
<p>EG:<br />
There were over 30 applicants for an ad in the paper here in Annapolis. Only 8 of us got interviews. I was one of them. They offered me a management position, I turned them down.</p>
<p>But, it has to be tastefully done, just a simple plain b&amp;w 1 inch by 2 inch headshot. Mine was in a bartending vest &amp; bowtie.</p>
<p>If you do it properly with a smiling face &amp; nice clothes, a candid &#8216;on the job&#8217; shot, then by all means go for it. It is working fabulously well for me.</p>
<p>In my opinion it just screams confidence.</p>

			<p><p>In hollywood it is a prerequisite to have a very professional headshot on the resume! It&#8217;s a nutty town. My thought is inspired by jeffreymorgenthaler.com comments about bartending being so wide &amp; diverse.</p>
<p> So true that the discos will have handsome young guys &amp; pretty sassy girls working. Whereas, an joint with a much more mature client, like fine dining, would tend to have older more professional bartenders, not sexy young guys &amp; girls in their 20&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Conversely, I do know of quite a few places that only hire men ! And I also know of places that only hire chicks!</p>
<p>Every employee brings something unique &amp; valuable to the table.<br />
Skills, appearance, youth, maturity, fresh attitude, seasoned player, old school, new school. There is a spot for everybody.</p>

			<p><p>Jeffrey,</p>
<p>Great tips on the resume, especially the part concerning previous work experience! Andrew is right, however, about a picture on your resume in Los Angeles. Typically you won&#8217;t be hired without one. Here it&#8217;s not considered tacky, just marketing yourself proficiently. Only in LA:)</p>

		<h3>The Most Important Bar Tool You’re Probably Not Using</h3>
	<p>I have a confession for you: I can’t remember how to make a Mai Tai. I’m serious, I can’t.  I mean, I know what goes in one, I know the legend of the drink, the names of the supposed creators, and the importance of the Mai Tai in modern cocktail culture.  I can [...]</p>
