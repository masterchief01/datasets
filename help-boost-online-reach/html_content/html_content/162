						<p>So  many athletes have it all. Most of us will spend a lifetime trying to  scrape together a tiny fraction of what they&rsquo;ve got in their early 20s.  And the sad part is, most of us won&rsquo;t even get close!&nbsp;</p><p>They&rsquo;ve got the fame. They&rsquo;ve got the looks. They&rsquo;ve got the talent. They&rsquo;ve got the girls. And, of course, they've got the money. And some of them have had it all for so long that they  don&rsquo;t even know what to do with it anymore. For many athletes there  seems to be a tipping point where a comfortable home and a nice set of  wheels just doesn&rsquo;t rev the engine like it used to. <br><br>It&rsquo;s  starts off small, usually. Some customized details on the Benz. Which  leads to another car...or two. Then a new vacation home, so there is  somewhere to drive the new cars. And then, before you know it, they&rsquo;re  spending their days in the casino and their nights at home bidding on  dinosaur bones on eBay. Which leaves them teetering on the verge of  financial ruin for the rest of their days. <br><br>It&rsquo;s probably a finer line than most of us even realize.</p><p>Some athletes do a swell job of managing their vast wealth and professional responsibilities. While others fail miserably at the same task. The one thing they have in common is the money burning a hole in the pocket of their designer duds.</p><p>We all know that there is only so much money that can be spent on responsible items before temptation takes over. So let's take a look at 25 of the most insane purchases made my professional athletes.</p>

						<p>Texans running back Arian Foster <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7652816/arian-foster-signs-5-year-deal-stay-houston-texans">was</a> signed to a five-year, $43.5 million contract in March 2012, and in  December he decided to pass on some of his good fortune to his offensive  lineman&mdash;in the form of 10 Segways. Yep. Segways.</p><p>The  last thing I want to do is crap all over Foster&rsquo;s good intentions, but  we all know the road to hell is paved with good intentions. A fleet of Segways may sound like a good idea in theory, but I don&rsquo;t think Foster  thought this through as thoroughly as he should have. First of all, a  top of the line Segway <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0012Y5AVC/ref=dp_olp_0?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=all">costs</a> just under $7,000&mdash;which is insane.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s the little issue of the weight limit. I checked out the official <a href="http://www.segway.com/support/faqs.php">website</a>, and the maximum weight Segway can handle is 260 pounds, not to exceed 270 with cargo. Then I checked out the <a href="http://www.houstontexans.com/team/roster.html">weight</a> of his offensive lineman, and not one of them tips the scale at less than 300 pounds.</p><p>Which  means that Foster dropped no less than $70,000 on ridiculous scooters  for a bunch of dudes who were probably too big for them in high school.  I&rsquo;m sure they appreciated the thought, but he would have been better off  just giving them a bag of cash or Starbucks gift cards.</p>

						<p>Before  I joined Twitter and started following a bunch of athletes, I had  absolutely no idea what a big deal sneakers are for professional  athletes. I knew shoes were a big deal for those Sex and the City broads, but had no clue that there so many big macho athletes who suffered with the same affliction. &nbsp;<br><br>Lots of big name superstars in the NBA have pretty epic sneaker collections&mdash;they have to spend their money on something, right? <br><br>Well,  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that nobody has invested more time, money and effort  into his sneaker collection than Nets forward Joe Johnson. In August  2012, <em>Dime</em> magazine ran a <a href="http://dimemag.com/2012/08/from-dime-70-joe-johnson-the-best-sneaker-collection-in-the-nba/">feature</a> entitled Joe Johnson &amp; The Best Sneaker Collection in the NBA. Let&rsquo;s just say that Johnson&rsquo;s 1,000+ pairs of sneakers are living better than you.<br><br>The  temperature-controlled closet has a fingerprint security device,  mirrored ceilings, contains a bed, television and basketball hoop, and  is large enough to comfortably fit six or seven friends for chill time.  Johnson also revealed that he loves the closet so much that sometimes he  naps in it.</p>

						<p>The  Cubs have a lot of overpaid deadweight on their roster, and chief among  them has to be left fielder Alfonso Soriano. And chief among the  deadweight in Soriano&rsquo;s life has to be this 2005 Hummer H2. This  behemoth eyesore probably looks nothing like the car he purchased back in  2005. No word on what Soriano paid for the car at the dealer, but it was  no less than $50,000. <br><br>Then he spent four years and <a href="http://bustedcoverage.com/2012/12/11/buy-alfonso-sorianos-stupid-loaded-hummer-for-36000-photos/">over</a> $100,000 tweaking the design. And in 2009, Soriano and his lumped out  Cubbie blue Hummer became the subject of national ridicule, when the  costly details of this monstrosity hit the <a href="http://withleather.uproxx.com/2009/03/soriano-knows-how-to-spend-money">web</a>. What do people expect though? It costs a lot of money to look this stupid. <br><br>Apparently  Soriano is ready to find a new automotive project to dump his bloated  paycheck into, because he has been trying to unload this gas guzzler  since December 2012. He won&rsquo;t even come close to matching his investment  though, unless he find one helluva a motivated buyer.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re in the  market for $36,000 worth of something terrible, place a bid <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=321046008065">on eBay</a>.</p>

						<p>Like  Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has far more  money than he knows what to do with. He&rsquo;s one of the highest paid  athletes on the planet and has already amassed a <a href="http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/richest-footballers-richest-athletes/ronaldo-net-worth/">net worth</a> approaching $150 million. <br><br>Ronaldo  must be of the mind that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t take it with you when you die,&rdquo;  which is why he has one of the most expensive hobbies in the  world&mdash;collecting sports cars.

In total, Ronaldo has plunked down no less $5 million for his prized fleet. <br><br>That&rsquo;s  an awful lot of fine Italian leather stained orange from bronzer, with  accompanying sticky headrests.

Bryant, never one to be  outdone, immediately ordered another five bottles. <br><br>Upping  the ante, Esfandiari followed suit and upped his order to 10 bottles. A  lesser man of lesser means may have just walked away at that point.

						<p>It&rsquo;s  no secret that retired boxer Mike Tyson wasn&rsquo;t very prudent when it  came to his finances at the height of his career. Which is why he is one  of just two athletes to appear on this list twice. A dubious distinction, indeed. <br><br>If you aren&rsquo;t completely aware of his bankruptcy situation, let me just say that his half-corked decision to <a href="http://sports.xin.msn.com/photogallery.aspx?cp-documentid=4776022&amp;page=5">buy</a> a trio of genetically deficient Bengal tigers, and keep them as pets, is one of his better investments. <br><br>At least tigers have some resale value. Bankruptcy reports in 2003 <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/outrageous-athlete-spending-2011-4?op=1">revealed</a> that Tyson purchased the three big cats for $140,000 simoleons. Also  revealed was the monthly cost of caring for them: $4,000...per tiger. So basically...they were $140,000 down...and $144,000 a year...for however long the tigers remained in his possession. <br><br>On  what planet does that sound like a desirable deal for pet ownership! Really puts that kitten your girlfriend wants in perspective, doesn&rsquo;t  it?</p>

						<p>Retired  major leaguer Jack Clark is proof that high-earning athletes  inexplicably filing for bankruptcy is nothing new. In 1992 Clark was in  the second year of a three-year deal, worth $8.7 million, with the Red  Sox. It was also the year that he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/08/sports/sports-people-baseball-jack-clark-files-for-bankruptcy.html">filed</a> for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in California, listing $6.7 million in debts. <br><br>Much  of his debt came from automobile purchases or investments in automobile  business ventures gone bad. Clark owned 17 cars, all of which cost over  $100,000, and most of which he still owed money on. <br><br>In  a situation like this, you might not think that one car would stand out  as a bigger mistake than the others, but you would definitely be wrong.  The 1990 Ferrari F40 that he purchased <a href="http://sports.ca.msn.com/other/photos/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=25864217&amp;page=7">for</a> $717,000, the year before filing for bankruptcy, is approximately 7x worse financial decision than the rest of his cars. <br><br>I  know cars are a pretty big deal, but who needs this many of them? It  doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money I had&mdash;the only way I&rsquo;d pay $717,000 for a  car is if it came with a briefcase in the backseat stuffed with no less  than $650,000 in cash.</p>

						<p>Unlike  tricked out sports cars and SUVs, which start depreciating in value the  moment you sign on the dotted line, boats actually aren&rsquo;t a terrible  investment. If you&rsquo;re responsible, gainfully employed, and know what  you&rsquo;re doing. Unfortunately for former NBA player Latrell Sprewell, he  possesses none of those qualities. <br><br>Sprewell  was forced into early retirement in 2005, after turning down a $21  million contract extension on the grounds that it wasn&rsquo;t enough money to  feed his family.  His family must eat an awful lot. The Timberwolves countered their  first offer with zero dollars and sent him on his way. Which gave him  more time to party on his $1.5 million Italian yacht, hilariously named  &ldquo;Milwaukee&rsquo;s Best.&rdquo; <br><br>Hopefully Sprewell enjoyed a full year of living the life on what remained of his NBA earnings, because the yacht was <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2986158">grounded</a> and repossessed by Federal Marshals after he was unable to make the payments. It was <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3241444">sold</a> at auction for $856,000&mdash;leaving Sprewell with a $295,138 balance due. <br><br>Talk about fiscal responsibility. He really could have used some of the money he sunk into that boat when his home was <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3241444">foreclosed </a>on a year later.</p>

						<p>Aside from the large-scale dog fighting operation that he funded, Michael Vick&rsquo;s second  worst investment has to be the $85,000 he spent on a custom fish pond  (and the additional $48,257 he spent for landscaping) for his home in  the weeks before going to jail. <br><br>Vick&rsquo;s bankruptcy <a href="http://www.georgiabankruptcyblog.com/archives/news-and-comments-bankruptcy-court-pleadings-show-how-michael-vick-spent-millions-of-dollars.html">report</a> shows that he was bleeding out money at an uncontrollable pace at the  time. So why he thought the best way to get back on track was by dumping  money into a fish pond...well...that&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess. Vick, rather  impressively, managed to burn through over $3.5 million in the six  months prior to the start of his prison term. <br><br>No doubt he&rsquo;s going to miss that money in the years to come.

His money problems were just coming to light in 2010, right around the time he purchased a $4.5 million <a href="http://straightfromthea.com/2010/03/17/allen-iverson-purchases-4-5-million-atlanta-mansion-inside-photos/%20%20">mansion</a> in Atlanta, GA&mdash;the same home he is currently fighting to keep out of <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2012/12/09/allen-iverson-foreclosure-atlanta-mansion/">foreclosure</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The main problem is that Iverson has been out of the NBA for a few years now, but he's still <a href="http://www.blackenterprise.com/money/iverson-broke-spending-money-divorce/">spending</a> like an NBA player.

His wages are currently being <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/31/allen-iverson-judge-cut-wages-jeweler_n_1245262.html">garnished</a> to pay off old debts to his jewelry and his wife has <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/12/10/allen-iverson-divorce-tawanna-iverson/">accused</a> of him of paying for diamonds, when she can't pay for rent.&nbsp;</p> <p>I've never understood the fascination with diamonds.

						<p>Wide  receiver Andre Rison played 13 seasons in the NFL. In 1995 the Browns  signed him to a five-year contract worth $17 million, which was the  largest contract ever for a wideout. During the ESPN <em>30 for 30&nbsp;</em>documentary <em>Broke</em>, Rison spoke candidly about his spending habits during his career. <br><br>As  if still trying to figure out where all the money went, Rison seemed to  surprise even himself as he recounted his financial misadventures. Of  all the ways Rison flushed his money down the toilet, the $1 million he <a href="http://www.mlive.com/sports/flint/index.ssf/2012/10/flint_native_andre_rison_says.html">guarantees</a> he spent on jewelry definitely stands out among them. <br><br>Maybe  it wouldn&rsquo;t seem as insane if things had worked out better for him.  After all, I can&rsquo;t imagine that Deion Sanders spent any less than $1  million on sparkly accessories over the course of his career.&nbsp;But he&rsquo;s  still got a job.&nbsp;And a house.</p><p>Like his career, Rison's house burned down in the '90s too.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>Titans  running back Chris Johnson&rsquo;s infamous gold teeth aren&rsquo;t quite on par  with many of the other lavish expenditures on this list. Actually, I&rsquo;m  not even entirely sure how much that grotesque yellow grin set him back.  <br><br>After some tedious <a href="http://www.animated-teeth.com/dental_crowns/t8_dental_crowns_cost.htm">research</a> online, my best estimate for the value of Johnson&rsquo;s six gold teeth is  somewhere in the neighborhood of $8,100 ($1,350 per tooth). That&rsquo;s an  awful lot of money to drop on something so hideous. The good news is  that Johnson is probably more punctual with his permanent gold teeth. <br><br>Prior to the implants, he <a href="http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/johnson-goes-back-gold-teeth-misses-bus-stadium">reportedly</a> wore a gold grill and missed the Titans team bus to the stadium in  2009, after returning to his hotel room to retrieve the golden dentures.  Oy vey. Johnson better save some of that big money he&rsquo;s making, because  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be working much in the real world. <br><br>So next time you&rsquo;re late for work, just tell your boss you forgot your gold grill at home and had to go back. He or she will totally understand.</p>

						<p>Legendary  boxer Evander Holyfield amassed $250 million in earnings over the  course of his lucrative career. He probably assumed a quarter of a  billion dollars was more money than he could burn through in two  lifetimes, let alone one.</p><p>But as it turns out, the only thing Holyfield was better at than boxing was shoveling his money into a metaphorical  black hole. <br><br>Holyfield&rsquo;s biggest financial misstep (besides his <a>11 kids</a>) was the purchase of a 235-acre <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/evander-holyfield-leaving-foreclosed-georgia-mansion-article-1.1112365">estate</a> in Fayette County, GA. Who knew the upkeep associated with a  54,000-square-foot 109-room mega-mansion situated on a massive farm  would be so costly? (See: Everyone except Evander Holyfield.) In 2008 he  was <a href="http://sports.ca.msn.com/other/photos/hey-big-spender?page=4">sued</a> for $500,000 in unpaid landscaping fees. <br><br>Holyfield spent much of the next few years with the property in and out of foreclosure, until he was finally <a href="http://www.boxinginsider.com/columns/evander-holyfield-tossed-out-of-his-private-white-house/">booted</a> for good in 2012. It&rsquo;s unclear how much of his fortune he threw into  this financial fire over the years, but he&rsquo;s still underwater. The  property sold for just $7.5 million at auction, which was just over half  of the $14 million Holyfield still owed on it. <br><br>If he had only consulted the Tom Hanks' classic real estate folly,&nbsp;<em>The Money Pit</em>, this whole nasty situation could have been avoided. &nbsp;</p>

						<p>It&rsquo;s  hard for me to even imagine a life in which the purchase of a private  jet is a plausible scenario. But I&rsquo;m going to try to use my imagination,  in an attempt to understand the circumstances that led to retired Bulls  great Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s ill-fated purchase of a $4.3 million Gulfstream jet in 2002. <br><br>The decision to purchase an airplane doesn&rsquo;t  seem like something that most people would make on a whim. What  happened is that Pippen forked over $4.3 million of his hard-earned  greenbacks for a jet that he thought could fly. But instead he got a jet  that needed $1 million worth of repairs and could not, in fact, fly. <br><br>The  jet was grounded for years while Pippen pursued a lawsuit against his  own lawyer, who he blamed for missing the inspection. He was later <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Scottie-Pippen-is-a-little-less-broke-these-days?urn=nba-252310">awarded</a> $2 million for his troubles. So...I guess it all kinda worked out in the end for Pippen. <br><br>I just can&rsquo;t seem to understand how it&rsquo;s even possible to buy a private jet without making sure it can fly, first. Hopefully lessons were learned. But who are we kidding? They probably weren't.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>If  there&rsquo;s one thing I learned from retired defensive tackle Warren Sapp&rsquo;s  bankruptcy declaration, it&rsquo;s that he is kind of a weirdo.</p><p>I realize  that my life not look too swell after being seized by the IRS and  auctioned off in a public venue. But, then again, I don&rsquo;t really have  anything worth seizing. Nor will I ever amass $6.5 million in assets and  $6.7 million in debt, as he has. &nbsp;<br><br>I&rsquo;m  just not that motivated a buyer. Sapp, on the other hand, is a pretty  easy sell and had a few prized possessions that caught the evil eye of  Uncle Sam&mdash;including his Florida mansion. Sapp has always been very  outspoken, and a borderline bully, which is why I think so many people  took such glee in reporting about his other possessions. <br><br>AOL Sporting News <a href="http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2012-11-02/warren-sapp-broke-fired-nfl-network-bankrupt-athletes-list">likened</a> his shoe collection to that of noted shoe enthusiast Imelda Marcos. Among his other possessions auctioned off <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/story/2012-04-07/warren-sapp-bankruptcy-florida/54097296/1">were</a> a lion skin rug (a necessity), a large painted of a nude woman  (essential), a collection of watches (fundamental), and a boxing glove  signed by Muhammad Ali (like oxygen). <br><br>Perhaps  all of those purchases made more sense at the time, but when you put  them all together, it definitely looks pretty insane.</p>

						<p>Eddy  Curry is a bright shining beacon that is representative of everything  that people who think there is something is wrong with sports, is wrong  with sports. He&rsquo;s chronically overweight and needed to <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=mc-spears_eddy_curry_miami_heat_nba_011912">lose</a> 100 pounds in 2011, just to be able to play basketball again. <br><br>Which  proves he&rsquo;s unapologetically lazy, because it&rsquo;s not easy for a 30-year-old professional athlete to keep 100 pounds of weight on&mdash;it takes  dedication. He&rsquo;s ridiculously overpaid and has been <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/judge_in_bank_hot_at_knick_sFkdHR3NoKrm2wvNvbkLfJ">raking</a> in $20 million large per season for the last several years. Despite the fact that he&rsquo;s a <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/jeff_pearlman/09/29/eddy.curry/index.html">noted</a> underachiever who never lived up to the talent and promise he once had. <br><br>Curry  is also very flippant with his finances and has had his wages garnished  on a number of occasions to pay off bad debts. His expenses became  public domain when he claimed that he was unable to afford the loan  payments in 2010. A claim that a Manhattan judge wasn&rsquo;t having any of. <br><br>Most of what was revealed was your average athlete over-indulgence stuff, but the one monthly <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/judge_in_bank_hot_at_knick_sFkdHR3NoKrm2wvNvbkLfJ">expense</a> that really stood out was the $1,075 he pays for cable.

Those cold dead eyes were created  from porcelain and the dreads from back diamond chains. <br><br>Reports didn&rsquo;t reveal the price of this shrunken head, but the market <a href="http://goldpricenetwork.com/kilogram/">price</a> for 1.3 kilograms of 14k gold today is over $40,000. So...cover that in  diamonds...tack on labor costs...and there&rsquo;s no way this thing cost any  less than $60,000. Take into consideration that a sucker with a vision  is a prime target for overcharging, and it could have very well cost  double that. <br><br>Something tells me it won&rsquo;t hold its value during the bankruptcy auction.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>Things simply haven&rsquo;t gone well for Chad Johnson over the last year. Actually, that&rsquo;s a bit of an understatement. Let&rsquo;s review: <br><br>He  was a non-factor in the Patriots&rsquo; Super Bowl loss to the Giants, then  he was released by the Patriots, then he was signed by the Dolphins,  then he was <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp12/story/_/id/8260872/chad-johnson-miami-dolphins-arrested-domestic-battery-charges">arrested</a> for domestic battery, then he was released by the Dolphins, then it was reported that he was <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/08/16/2954963/former-miami-dolphin-chad-johnson.html">facing</a> foreclosure on his Miami condo, and then he was <a href="http://global.christianpost.com/news/chad-johnson-sued-for-130000-amid-foreclosure-debacle-80320/">sued</a> by a former employee for unpaid services. <br><br>And  that was just through August 2012! That stretch of bad luck may be  enough to sideline those of us living in the real world. But since  Johnson lives in a fantasy land with bottomless stacks of money, he had  no problem bouncing back. Perhaps his positive attitude has something to  do with his under the sea escape hatch? <br><br>This  over-the-top custom tank is the work of Acrylic Tank Manufacturing  owners King and Raymer, who have their own reality show called Tanked  on Animal Planet. It&rsquo;s not clear if Johnson had to actually pay for  this structure or if the brothers did it for publicity and the  opportunity to take <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2030666/NFL-stars-Chad-Ochocincos-amazing-fish-tank-bedroom.html">pictures</a> in front of his Lamborghini. <br><br>Whether  or not he paid for the parts and labor is irrelevant, because he&rsquo;ll be  paying out the nose every month just to keep that thing functioning. And  I&rsquo;d be willing to wager a large sum of money that those fish are all  dead by now.</p>

						<p>White tigers aren&rsquo;t the only thing that boxing great Mike Tyson blew his fortune on. According to bankruptcy <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10290-2004Jul23_3.html">reports</a>,  in just a few years Tyson dropped well over $10 million on cars and  motorcycles, jewelry and clothes, as well as lavish parties and home  furnishings. Although, at least he (presumably) got to enjoy those  things himself for a period of time. <br><br>I  can&rsquo;t imagine there&rsquo;s quick chunk of money Tyson would like to get back  more than the $2 million he spent on a bathtub for his ex-wife Robin  Givens. He gave her the bathtub, which I can only imagine was made of  solid gold, on the same birthday that he threw her a $410,000 party. <br><br>Personally,  I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt comfortable about reaping additional birthday  benefits from someone who was crazy enough to spend $2 million on a  bathtub. But hey, maybe that&rsquo;s just me. The financial reports don&rsquo;t give  any in-depth details about this mythical bathing bucket, which is a  shame. <br><br>I did a little bathtub research online, and the most expensive bathtub I could find is $1.74 million <a href="http://www.designbuzz.com/worlds-luxury-bathtub-le-grand-queen-caijou/">Le Grand Queen</a>&mdash;which  is said to be 180 million years old, the minerals of which were dug out  of the most perilous terrain in Indonesia by 200 people over the course  of 600,000 hours. <br><br>So...uh...I hope Tyson&rsquo;s bathtub was pretty freaking special.</p>
