<p>Yes! Of course it is! Don&#8217;t give up! There is hope. The key is to understand how your body works and to have a comprehensive plan that you will execute over a reasonable period of time. Translation: this is not a quick fix. But, remember, it is doable! Take the turtle approach, slow and steady, and you&#8217;ll get there.</p>
<p>Now it is true that fat cells don&#8217;t disappear unless you surgically remove them. But you don&#8217;t need to go that route because fat cells can shrink! You may think &#8220;Oh, boy, this is going to be difficult.&#8221; It will take work, yes, but remember it&#8217;s not impossible. There is a solution. You can trim your tummy. This is great news!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve assembled a guide here that includes the best tips from my own personal experience as well as other experts in the fields of diet, exercise, and stress-management.</p>
<p>The tips below work best when combined as an overall program. The three areas we&#8217;ll cover are diet, exercise, and anti-stress strategies. Get committed, create your personal plan, and you will lose your belly fat!</p>
<p><em>If you want the <strong>total solution in full detail</strong>, check out my ebook &#8220;<strong><a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/05/30/the-secrets-to-a-healthy-life/" target="_blank">The Secrets to a Healthy Life</a></strong>,&#8221; which details the fully researched health regimen <strong>I used to lose 15 pounds</strong> and become a much healthier and happier person. (And yes, a flatter tummy too!)</em></p>
<h3><strong>Diet Tips for Losing Belly Fat</strong></h3>
<p>If you want a sleeker tummy, then you&#8217;ll want to lose weight overall and more specifically you&#8217;ll want to lose fat. Spot reductions are not feasible. However if you carry most of the weight in your mid-section then the good news is that&#8217;s where you will see the results first. Here are the tips for healthy dieting:</p>
<p><strong>1. Weight Loss Plan</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate your <a id="kkrq" title="Basal Metabolic Rate" href="http://www.caloriesperhour.com/index_burn.php">Basal Metabolic Rate</a> and figure out how many calories your body burns daily just sitting on a couch.</li>
<li>Then add in the <a id="w.dk" title="calories you burn with exercise and activity daily" href="http://www.caloriesperhour.com/index_burn.php" target="_blank">calories you burn with exercise and daily activity</a>.</li>
<li>Calculate your weight loss goal, time frame, and <a id="xpj-" title="amount of calories you need to cut out daily" href="http://www.caloriesperhour.com/index_loss.php" target="_blank">amount of calories you need to cut out daily</a> to reach your goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. What to Eat</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Balanced Diet where your calorie breakdown follows these percentages approximately: (check out <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/04/30/how-to-eat-healthier/" target="_blank">How to Eat Healthier</a>for more information)
<ul>
<li>35% <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2011/11/21/sweet-grilled-winter-chicken/" target="_blank">lean protein</a> (vegetarian is healthiest &#8211; beans, nuts, tofu, seitan, lots of green veggies)</li>
<li>35% high fiber carbohydrates (shoot for 25-30g fiber per day)</li>
<li>30% healthy fats (olive oil, flaxseed oil &#8211; bear in mind you can&#8217;t cook with flaxseed oil, add it to salads or already steamed vegetables for flavor and other important nutrients)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eat lots of vegetable and fruits that have a low glycemic index. Here is a <a id="nmkp" title="list of foods and their glycemix index" href="http://www.nutricoach.net/low_gi_foods.html" target="_blank">list of foods and their glycemix index</a>. To reduce fat, steam your vegetables or stir fry in broth.</li>
<li><strong>Drink Your Fruits/Veggies!</strong> This is an easy way to eat healthy. Blend up <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/04/21/my-favorite-smoothie/" target="_blank">smoothies</a>, vegetable drinks, or quick puree soups. <strong>I can’t recommend anything more highly than a <a href="https://secure.vitamix.com/?COUPON=06-003178" target="_blank">VitaMix blender</a>.</strong> It’s a little pricey, but they last a lifetime and they make eating healthy a breeze. I love mine!</li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Consider taking a <a id="y0sc" title="CLA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_linoleic_acid" target="_blank">CLA</a> (Conjugated linoleic acid), 1000mg 3 times a day with meals. In studies CLA was shown to reduce body fat, in particular in the belly area. If you have diabetes or are at risk for diabetes, check with your doctor first.</span> </span><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I no longer recommend CLA supplements. I don&#8217;t think that CLA will hurt you, but from all my research, it appears that the most effective, safe, and healthy way to lose weight is to follow a <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/04/30/how-to-eat-healthier/" target="_blank">whole foods plant based diet called a Vegan diet</a>.

(FYI: It&#8217;s not a diet of misery. It&#8217;s a delicious way to eat, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t do it!)</li>
<li>If you eat meat, buy organic meats which have lower saturated fat content and higher natural levels of CLA.</li>

<h3><strong>Exercise Tips to Lose Belly Fat</strong></h3>
<p>When trying to lose belly fat the important thing to remember is to include whole body exercises and to rotate your workouts in order to continually provide a challenge for your body. Otherwise your body becomes acclimated and does not receive as much benefit as if you vary your workouts. So for example if you always jog 30 minutes every day, that will be less effective than if you do different types of workouts every few days. Here are the exercise tips for losing tummy fat:</p>
<p><strong>1. Do 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily</strong>. Brisk walking or jogging are great low cost exercises to do, but anything that you enjoy and that gets your heart rate up is fine. Shoot for at least 3-5 times per week at a minimum. Here is an excellent <a id="izp8" title="article on varying your jogging workouts" href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/10/10-great-workouts-to-spice-up-your-running-program/" target="_blank">article on varying your jogging workouts</a>. And here is an article on <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/07/04/how-to-become-a-runner-a-simple-method-for-beginners/" target="_blank">how to become a runner</a>.<br />
<strong>2. Do whole body workouts 2-3 times per week</strong> such as yoga (strenuous) or Pilates or a weight-lifting program. These types of exercises will build muscle, increase metabolism, and make losing fat easier. Here is a <a id="mne:" title="link to my favorite yoga and Pilates videos" href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2007/06/16/top-10-yoga-videos-bonus-pilates-too/" target="_blank">link to my favorite yoga and Pilates videos</a>.<br />
<strong>3. Instead of cruches</strong>, try these <a id="yoec" title="Army exercises that strengthen and tone your stomach" href="http://www.armytimes.com/offduty/health/ONLINE.MUSCLE.SITUPS/" target="_blank"><strong>Army exercises that strengthen and tone your stomach</strong></a> as part of a whole body workout.<br />
<strong>4. Hold your stomach muscles in during the day</strong> whenever you can think of it. This will strengthen your abdominal girdle and create a flatter stomach.<br />
<strong>5. Sit up straight </strong>and pull in your stomach muscles when sitting. You might want to create physical reminders to do this such as a post-it note at your desk or a loose rubber band around your wrist.<br />
<strong>6. Stretching</strong>. Take breaks throughout the day to do back bending stretches that will stretch out your stomach muscles and keep them from becoming shortened which is not good for your stomach or your back.</p>

<h3><strong>Anti-Stress Strategies for Losing Belly Fat</strong></h3>
<p>You may have seen commercials for supplements that will help you regulate the hormone cortisol in order to lose belly fat. Well controlling cortisol is very good idea, however supplements are not the way to go. What you want to do is reduce the stress that produces the cortisol hormone.</p>
<p>Cortisol is a hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism and blood pressure. When you encounter stress, including lack of sleep, cortisol boosts your energy level by producing glucose. If you have chronically high stress levels then you&#8217;ll have too much of this hormone. This will keep your appetite stimulated and also keeps glucose production high. The body converts excess glucose into fat, which is usually stored in the midsection for quick access by your body.</p>
<p>How do you neutralize the stress of daily life? With relaxation techniques. Here are some helpful ideas:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Get Enough Sleep</span>. Only you know how much sleep you need, but if you are routinely dragging during the day feeling sleepy, lethargic, exhausted, etc., then you probably need to get more sleep.</p>
<p><strong>2. De-Stress Breaks</strong>. Take small breaks throughout the day, say every 1-3 hours. On the break you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a 5-10 minute walk</li>
<li>Try some <a id="gsm4" title="yoga" href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2007/06/09/free-online-yoga/" target="_blank">yoga</a> <a id="ph6n" title="at your desk" href="http://www.dumblittleman.com/2007/10/simple-stretches-you-can-do-at-your.html" target="_blank">at your desk</a>.</li>
<li><a id="c3v9" title="Take a Meditation " href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2007/06/06/how-to-nap-at-work-or-anyplace-you-need-a-rest/" target="_blank">Take a Meditation &#8220;Nap</a>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Try Tai Chi, Qigong, or Yoga</strong> a few times a week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are a list of <a id="mne:" title="link to my favorite yoga and Pilates videos" href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2007/06/16/top-10-yoga-videos-bonus-pilates-too/" target="_blank">my favorite yoga videos</a>.</li>
<li>Here are two Qigong videos I recommend:</li>
<li>Qigong for Stress Relief &#8211; Francesco Garripoli</li>
<li>Qigong beginning practice &#8211; Francesco Garripoli</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Meditate Daily</strong>. Meditate for 10-20 minutes 1-2 times per day, once in the morning and once in the later part of the day. This will set the tone for your day and help curb the automatic stress response. Here are a few recommended meditation and self-hypnosis guides:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>5. Calming Guidance</strong>. Consider listening to positive audio tapes in your car or on your daily exercise. The one that I highly recommend is <a id="dtal" title="Andrew Matthews, " href="http://www.successandhappiness.net/" target="_blank">Andrew Matthews, &#8220;Happiness and Success&#8221; audio program</a>. The website is one of those salesy sites, but never fear, this is probably the best self-help product I ever bought. I listen to it often and always refer my friends to his books and audio programs.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Considerations When Trying to Lose Belly Fat</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Hypothyroidism</strong>. If you follow all these steps and can&#8217;t lose weight check with your doctor as you may have an under active thyroid which can throw off your metabolism and cause you to gain weight.</p>
<p><strong>2. Buddy Up for Success</strong>. Enlist a friend, colleague, or family member to join your challenge. You&#8217;ll be more successful if you have someone to encourage and push you!<br />
<br style="font-weight: bold;" /><strong>3. Hire a Personal Trainer</strong>. Think of all the stuff you buy that you don&#8217;t need. Why not spend money on something that could make a real difference in your health? This is great if you need help with discipline or with crafting an exercise routine.</p>
<p><strong>4. Make Healthy Eating Easy</strong>. Fruits and veggie eating is the best way to be healthy and lose weight. You can eat as much as you want! Blend them into smoothies and soups. I can’t recommend anything more highly than a <a href="https://secure.vitamix.com/?COUPON=06-003178" target="_blank">VitaMix blender</a>. It’s a little pricey, but they last a lifetime and they make eating healthy a breeze. I love mine!</p>

			<p>Thanks for this great article on weight loss.  I especially like the inclusion of anti-stress strategies.  I do have a quick question for everybody out there&#8230;  What is your opinion on the effectiveness of CLA?  I&#8217;ve tried it before and can&#8217;t be sure I noticed a difference.  Is it worth the cost and apparently risk to use it?  Thanks in advance!</p>

			<p>Very nice article,</p>
<p>I do agree that stress will keep our appetite stimulated and keeps glucose production high. What I just know from this article is cortisol is the hormon that responsible for regulates carbohydrate metabolism and blood pressure.  </p>
<p>The key words to be success to loose belly fat are commitment, disiplin and practice. by doing these, we can be succeded to be slim and free from belly fat.</p>

			<p>You have a specific result you want. You want to see your abs. The &#8220;6- pack&#8221; look. </p>
<p>We can break this down to 2 factors.</p>

<p>2) You must build the muscle fiber of the abdominal muscles</p>
<p>2 steps are all it takes.  I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s easy.

			<p>Thanks for the great info on this article.  I agree, getting into a balanced diet is necessary in the intent of weight loss and loss of belly fat.  Striking a balance between carbo, fats and proteins is a good way to start.  Oftentimes, we overload on carbs thinking this won&#8217;t get us fat.   But it can actually!  Too much carbo in the system prevents the uptake of stored fat as an energy resource and that&#8217;s how we end up on the flab side&#8211;even if we cut down on fats.  It would also help to get a daily dietary supplement such as flax seed (like you said). This one helps regulate metabolism and weight as well.</p>

			<p>Can I add something about dieting to your excellent post?</p>
<p>Dieting is the practice of ingesting food in a regulated fashion to achieve or maintain a controlled weight. In many cases the goal is weight loss, but some athletes aspire to gain weight (usually in the form of muscle) and diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight.</p>

			<p>Your advice to consider taking a CLA (Conjugated linoleic acid), 1000mg 3 times a day with meals links to the wikipedia site; it provides information about CLA and says it may or may not be harmful to the human body.  From my reading, it provides more evidence that it would be HARMFUL.  I would suggest anyone willing to take  CLA talk to a doctor first.  Reducing your life span to loss a few pounds is NOT WORTH IT.</p>

			<p>Great article, you really cover a lot here. It&#8217;s definitely a balancing act and no one thing on it&#8217;s own is best. Like most things, there are several ways to lose belly fat, at least there are several exercises. You&#8217;ve listed a few as well as given resources to other exercises. I know I found out a couple of new things about losing tummy fat. The right diet and the right exercises combined is the best way to go.I think a lot of people will benefit from this.</p>

			<p>@Sarav &#8211; my goal here was to put forth the best information and resources to help people lose belly fat in the most effective way possible, with no gimmicks. There are several amazon links, yes.</p>
<p>This does not make the information in this post any less valid. Most of the books, I personally recommend.  Folks can certainly borrow most of these books from their local library instead of buying them. I also made a point to recommend books that offer a different approach to tackling this difficult, but achievable goal. There are many ways to skin this cat. What matters is that each person find the approach that they can stick with.</p>
<p>Also notice that there are many links to totally free resources.</p>
<p>If a reader purchases a book that I recommended through Amazon, that helps support the free advice that I write about. It doesn&#8217;t cost them any extra.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who supports Life Learning Today with Amazon purchases. I hope that everyone succeeds in their goal to lose weight. If anyone has questions or comments on this topic, I welcome them! </p>
<p>Please share your successes and struggles here! We&#8217;d love to hear about them to congratulate you and to encourage you on your journey!</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment, Sarav. Wishing you all the best.</p>

			<p>You&#8217;re 62. Your skin has stretched and had been in that state a majority of your life. It&#8217;s good that you lost all that weight, but your skin has lost most, if not all it&#8217;s elasticity. So to answer your question, &#8220;highly unlikely&#8221;.</p>

			<p>@Tony &#8211; you&#8217;re right that stretched skin can be difficult to fix, but the weight can be lost. I&#8217;m no expert, but maybe if it is lost over a long period of time produces a better chance of the skin shrinking? I&#8217;m just hypothesizing here.</p>
<p>But for those who really lose the weight, if there is a lot of excess skin, it can be surgically removed. Of course there are risks with any surgery, so all the factors have to be weighed carefully when making such a decision.</p>

			<p>Good advice. Women should not fear weight training &#8211; pump some iron, so compound exercises like squats, rows, barbell curls, bench press. Women do not generally bulk up, and weight training is an excellent way to burn fat. If in doubt, watch the Olympic runners, and see how many female athletes have six packs. Train hard, eat well.</p>

			<p>Hi, I&#8217;d really love a quick reply to this. This is gonna sound kind of lame, but I was wondering is there&#8217;s any sort of routine I can do to temporarily shrink my belly fat in just 3 days. It doesn&#8217;t have to be permanent but I&#8217;m going out round town with my friends on Friday, and I just want to look nice as my belly will be showing. I&#8217;m not crazy, I don&#8217;t want a dangerous diet  or anything, but I wondered is there were any exercises I could do just to tighten it up for my night out. Thanks.</p>

			<p>What I wouldn&#8217;t give for a belly like the Shania Twain looking woman in the picture.  I guess I can dream a little bit&#8230;hehe.</p>
<p>Great tips for a diet.  I love eating carbs and that is a real hang up for me, especially trying to maintain a low carb diet.  I found out something that has been very helpful, so maybe it will help your readers as well.</p>
<p>You can eat starchy foods.  You just need to eat them before you exercise.  That way they are burned for something good and not stored as fat.  This tip has really helped maintain my weight.</p>
<p>good luck everybody</p>

			<p>@Anna &#8211; sorry to get to your question so late. Yes. I have been away from my blog for a while with my &#8220;day job.&#8221;</p>
<p>To answer your question, there&#8217;s nothing that I would recommend to lose belly fat in 3 days. You could possibly loose water weight by switching over to a low-sodium whole foods plant based vegan diet for a few days. By eliminating dairy and meat and possibly wheat (if you are sensitive to it) you could reduce chronic inflammation thereby losing some (water) weight.</p>
<p>That is what I would recommend for a 3 day diet and also for a life long diet. Check out my post on &#8220;The Secrets to a Healthy Life.&#8221; </p>
<p>Wishing you all the best!</p>

			<p>I was overweight for many years causing a lot of heart ache and pain.  I was in a bad way and even hurt my back because of it.  I tried many forms of exercise until i discovered Pilates this worked for me and has helped a lot.  I thought that these simple easy looking exercises would never help but i persevered and i&#8217;m glad i did.  that was 4 years ago now and i have lost so much weight that i feel confident for the first time in my life and my back core muscles are strong again giving me the ability to live life to the full.  If anyone reads the information provided by you and follows a pilates exercises i know they will become like me.  Thanks for the wonderful information keep up the good work.</p>

			<p>First let me begin by saying that you have put together a very informative article with a lot of helpful tips. I am a young mother (23 yrs. old). My daughter is 3. I gained 60 lbs. during my pregnancy and so far I have only been able to loose 30 lbs. of that which I lost immediately after having her. So, needless to say, I have been carrying around 30-40 lbs. of extra weight for 3 years now. I have tried numerous diets but I can&#8217;t seem to stick to any of them. Do you have any suggestions for getting motivated and staying motivated? Also, is there anything that I should do in the beginning to jump start my new way of eating (maybe like a specific diet to detoxify or boost my metabolism)? Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks in advance.</p>

			<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Nice article &#8211; What I found really changed everything for me was the bodyweight exercises that you touch on.<br />
For me, 80% of my workout is based on function training and multi-joint exercises &#8211; dumbbell rows, snatches, squats, working your back and legs in general as they are some of the largest muscles. This has helped me boost my metabolism loads, therefore resulting in me shredding pounds.</p>
<p>Good stuff.<br />

			<p>@Amy &#8211; it sounds like you are exercising a lot! My advice is shoot for health, fun and loving yourself. Here&#8217;s what I mean:</p>
<p>Exercise is great. Do the exercise that makes you happy and appreciate your strengths. If gymnastics does that for you, then focus on that and not a small amount of fat around your middle. Women have all different bodies, but generally speaking most women have more fat then men. Since you are 14 the girls on your team may not have developed that layer yet. (But they will!)</p>
<p>Exercise should be fun and support good health. Do you feel healthy and strong? Do you have fun with it?</p>
<p>Have you considered branching into dance, in particular middle eastern or belly dance? I do this and I find that it builds self-esteem and love for your body as well as providing excellent exercise. And it is so much fun! I have learned to love my tummy and the small layer of fat.  It makes the dance more beautiful.</p>
<p>Maybe dancing is not for you, but please do find a sport or activity that not only keeps you healthy but supports your self-esteem. Don&#8217;t find the beautiful body that you have. Cherish it for all that it does for you everyday.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

			<p>Thank you for that info. I became vegetarian and put on loads of weight just in my tummy while the rest of my body is completely thin! I looked like a strawberry! I went for a cholesterol check during  routine check and I couldn&#8217;t believe it when I heard that me! vegetarian had a result of 5.4!! Vegetarian and 28! I couldn&#8217;t believe it!</p>
<p>I have been swimming every day for the past 6 months, at first my body was so unused to this exercise that I got very sick with a flu. When that passed I went back to swimming and I lost loads of weight and started to build up.</p>
<p>Now I am in the gym as well and I hope it will work.</p>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>1) Is it possible to be just unlucky with your genetics and never be able to loose it? </p>
<p>2) Is bloating ever mistaken for fat? I am worried that I might be allergic to some food or something because if I eat bread or anything with wheat I bloat up like a football! Now really I am not being funny but it is like my tummy is 10 times the size!!! It is awful.</p>
<p>3) I know I said two questions but this one really came to mind, I am so determined to get rid of this awful fat that I am going to the gym for an hour and the pool for an hour (Im a good swimmer), is this too much do you think? If I give it a break for about 3 days and then go I can do WAYYYY more but then I feel guilty for not going those three days and I get cravings for the gym!!</p>
<p>Thanks <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />

			<p>There is no possible way to lose belly flab.  Once it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s always there unless you have surgery.  I&#8217;m tired of these ridiculous lies getting people&#8217;s hopes up.  Diet and exercise never proved to lose belly flab.  Losing weight?  sure.  Gaining muscle?  sure.  Losing flab?  Impossible.  It&#8217;s a part of you.</p>

			<p>Buddying up never really worked for me, we&#8217;d end up cheating on our diets together. I was watching Dr. Phil the other day and he mentioned that one should be around those who are &#8220;like-minded&#8221;. However, I think that is the problem for alot of us dieters, we are around family and friends who helped get us overweight to begin with. Its a double-edged sword many times they are there to support us, but they won&#8217;t help us with accountability as much as we&#8217;d like. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to add a tip, not really for actual fatloss, but to stay committed. </p>
<p>Its a good idea to take a starting picture spread of yourself so that you have a visual of the start of your weightloss program. Every Month take another set of pictures so that you can see the progress over time. This way you can both make adjustments to your program if you have plateaued, but also so that you can look back to the beginning, see the progress you&#8217;ve made, and use it as a motivational tool.</p>

			<p>@Elawwelen &#8211; fat cells can shrink and eventually fat cells do die although at a much slower rate than other cells. It&#8217;s not impossible. Plus what do we have to lose?</p>
<p>If we try, we will become healthier at the very least, feeling good. At the best we will also become more trim. We can&#8217;t lose by trying. And you can always improve your situation. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<p>Should a flat stomach be our goal afterall? Maybe not. A bit of fat is healthy. (Women min 10%/ max 30%) (men min 2%/ max 25%)</p>
<p>I know that it is difficult in the western culture with the ideal being a flat stomach. I say work on your health and also your confidence at the same time. Dress nicely, carry yourself with good posture, and be happy with yourself. Practice that as much as your stomach exercises and you will improve the quality of your life right away!</p>

			<p>@David &#8211; if you were eating lots of dairy as a vegetarian that could cause some weight gain. You might want to find ways to reduce or eliminate dairy in your diet and you&#8217;ll probably see the pounds fall off. To answer your questions:<br />
1. Everyone has a unique weight that is healthy for them. For some this is larger than others. I would say focus on your body fat percentage and how you feel health wise. You can always improve your body at least a little bit (if it is needed) with persistence and effort.<br />
2. Yes, bloating can look like fat! If there are foods that make you bloat, try to avoid them such as wheat gluten. There are so many great alternatives. Learn new ways of cooking and eating and that does NOT mean giving up taste! <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Here&#8217;s a book on gluten free eating: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470178108?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=myonlnov-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0470178108" rel="nofollow">Gluten-Free Cooking For Dummies</a>. Personally I have to stay away from dairy for this reason, which is no problem at all!<br />
3. Regarding exercise, I would say do whatever routine that is sustainable for you. You might want to alternate and do 1 hour gym one day and then swimming the next. But if your current program works for you then keep it up!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

			<p>@help seeker &#8211; simply put:<br />
1. Believe you can. (Because you can!)<br />
2. Make an exercise plan and healthy eating plan you can stick to. (See my <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/02/28/5-simple-ways-to-eat-healthier/" rel="nofollow">healthy eating article</a>)<br />
3. Be in it for the long haul. Put one foot in front of the other each day.<br />
4. Love yourself today. Enjoy yourself today. Focus on what you have, not what you don&#8217;t have. Always dress in clothes that flatter you no matter where you are in your progress so that you will feel good about yourself.</p>
<p>5. Smile and <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/02/12/awakening-joy/" rel="nofollow">find joy everyday</a>!</p>
<p>Life is more than a flat tummy. Work on it, yes. But enjoy the journey. Be happy today.</p>

			<p>Thank you so much for your article, it really help me. Sometimes when i lose hope in losing weight i read something to keep me going. this helped me. I use ab rocekt everyday twice/day and i walk 30 mins 4 days a week and i eat healthy food. My belly is still fat. I gained weight due to high stress and family issues. Now im trying to lose weight, sometimes its frustrating because i want insult results its not possilble. I can see the changes in my body but its very slow. I guess i have to be patient. i was 90 pounds last year so far i lost 9 pounds. I was 132 pounds in march 2009 now iam 124 pounds(july 2009) my aim is to shed at least 15 pounds more.</p>

			<p>@James23 &#8211; if that is your goal, you can do it. The formula is simple. Lots of stomach and full body exercises. You&#8217;ll need to do aerobic exercise too in order to reduce fat if needed. And many different kinds of stomach exercises, from crunches to pilates type exercises to dead weight squats to push ups. And then throw in some strenuous dancing too!</p>
<p>Put in the work and you will see the results.<br />
Make a plan to ensure success.<br />
Then execute the plan.<br />
Get a goal buddy if you have difficulty sticking to the plan.</p>
<p>You can do it!</p>

			<p>@Angela &#8211; a couple things come to mind.</p>
<p>(small reminder in case this applies to you: everyone has some fat under their skin that is healthy. Sometimes it is &#8220;heavier&#8221; in our minds than on our bodies.)</p>
<p>But assuming that the fat is larger than on the rest of your body, then my suggestion is to do two things:</p>
<p>Diet: get rid of &#8220;bad&#8221; fats from your diet &#8211; animal fats (from meat &amp; dairy) and trans fats (any product that lists &#8220;hydrogenated&#8221; in the ingredients list).  Good fats are fine in reasonable amounts : olive oil, flaxseed oil, canola oil.<br />
Lower your calorie intake by 100-200 calories a day.</p>
<p>Exercise: Do aerobic exercise 30-45 minutes per day 5-6 days per week. Do weight bearing exercise 2-3 days per week. (Check out my book, <a href="http://lifelearningtoday.com/2008/05/30/the-secrets-to-a-healthy-life/" rel="nofollow">The Secrets of a Healthy Life</a>, for more info.)</p>
<p>Aerobic will burn calories and reduce your fat stores. (as long as you&#8217;re not eating more calories than your body burns&#8230;see above references for calculating your daily calories)</p>
<p>Weight training will build overall and area-specific muscle tone, reducing the look of flabbiness that happens when natural fat levels don&#8217;t have enough muscle. Also building muscle will raise your metabolism and help you burn more calories all day long, including when you are at rest.</p>
<p>Take the long term approach. Seek to lose this fat and tighten your muscles over say a 1 to 2 year period. Be consistent and disciplined and you will have success!!!</p>

<p>I really agree with the advice to loose weight over a long period of time &#8211; just doing it fast wont work. So do your best to stick with your diet and gym and in time it will go.</p>
<p>So far it has taken me 9 months and that is from heavy swimming and running, but it is happening. I know if I did weights it would be faster but I like my CV work as weights just hurt! hehe but trust me it is working.</p>
<p>My family seem to have your curse &#8211; none of us would ever put a pound on our hips or the rest of our bodies &#8211; just the belly area. So imagine a strawberry cartoon with little tiny feet and legs &#8211; that is our curse hehe so the only way to get over this is to accept that your genetics are this way and so you need to look after yourself more than others.</p>
<p>Also AVOID DRINKING ALC!!! drink seems to pound it on for us!! I don&#8217;t drink so I am lucky but other family members do and you can see it! If you do drink then go for spirits with diet drinks, vodka like is 60 cals per glass and with diet coke that is zero extra, so something to consider. Or else do what I do &#8211; give it up!! I can tell you that you are a lot more attractive with a great body than a six pack or beer !</p>

			<p>I am thin everywhere except for a huge belly!..My belly history  is kind of funny i was too skinny till about 14 (people virtually used to force me to eat )Then i started putting on weight a lot of weight but only in my belly area . I lost all of it when i was 19 i was back to my skinnyself&#8230;I am 27 now and have a big belly and its time to get rid of it .Its gonna be a lot of work though.I weigh about 216lbs now(Now the same people who forced me to eat ask me to eat less <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>
<p>1)Walk and Run .I can really walk at will i have been walking for like 8 Miles a day in about 120minutes ..I have been doing it for a week despite everyone advising me against it becuase it could hurt my back in the long run! .Except a little bit of stiffess in my body i dont really feel any pain..Run i really havent tried since i got this fat but i could easily do about 3miles nonstop.</p>
<p>2)Diet- Now this is something i have never tried in my entire life <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  fat or not fat ..I am an Indian so it means i eat  lot of rice lot of very spicy and oily meat(Curry as we call it <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ) .I dont drink very often but when i do i almost do a full bottle of Bacardi with coke , I also smoke a lot almost 15 cigs a day&#8230; I have worked in almost 15 countries now that hasnt helped too much because in some countries they havent heard the word &#8220;Vegeterian&#8221;If you are wondering which country most Arab countries are like that <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>@Joe &#8211; my advice would be<br />
1)to keep up the walk/running. Just do an amount that is safe for your heart. If you&#8217;re unsure, check with your doctor.<br />
2) start building some muscle a few days a week with resistance training such as weight training. <a href="http://09f5fwt0ygulrd4o08vfufuh6x.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=FBF-comments" rel="nofollow">Fat Burning Furnace</a> is a program I have used that has an excellent program for doing this. I highly recommend it.<br />
3)Cut out liquid calories like Coke and alcohol.<br />
4)Eat a lot of nutrient rich foods like veggies, fruit, beans. Fill in with whole grains too. And last, if at all, would be organic lean meat or fish. (FYI -meats are not necessary)<br />
5) Reduce or eliminate high sugar, high (animal and trans-)fat foods, and other foods with lots of chemicals.</p>
<p>Over time, you WILL lose your belly if you do these steps<br />
Bonus advice: Quit smoking so you can enjoy your life and your reduced belly!!! Check back soon. I will have an article on how to do this very soon!</p>

			<div class="commenttext">
			<p>Hi, just found this site and found it very encouraging. I am looking to loose 20 pounds in the next month for a photo shoot and just started back on my exercise and healthy eating routine. I started my own internet business a couple of years ago and in the last year and a bit spent thousands of hours behind my computer ending up eating anything that was quick, easy and a sugar rush, because of this 25 extra pounds crept up around my midsection and thighs especially. At 42 it&#8217;s harder to loose then before but I was always had high energized days of physical exercise from gardening, house work, three kids and waitress in busy restaurants so keeping myself slimmed down wasn&#8217;t as much of an effort. I miss my toned body, even if I don&#8217;t get down to as slim as I was. Question if you can answer it. As I work out with 30 minutes of cardio then 30 minutes of alternating days of free weights and yoga, will I really notice a change in my weight on my scale since I&#8217;m also building muscle and muscle weighs more then fat? Just wondering if I should be a scale watcher and be discouraged if I don&#8217;t notice the number dropping on the scale but feel slimmer, lighter and more toned. Thanks for any help you may have .. Let&#8217;s Get Fit!!</p>

			<p>What a thorough article! I completely agree with the idea of using a personal trainer to lose weight in a healthy way. It&#8217;s not a luxury so much as an investment in your long-term health. Personal trainers will hold you accountable, and create personalized, targeted training sessions for you. Losing fat should really be a whole-body, lifelong experience.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the great article!</p>

			<p>@Amanda &#8211; to answer your question, try to stay away from the scale for the first few week to a month, because, yes, muscle does weigh more so although you&#8217;ll be getting slimmer and more toned, your weigh might not change much as you transition some of your fat over to muscle.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget to watch caloric intake. It must net out to a deficit of calories in order to lose weight. You can exercise a lot and still gain weight if you are not eating right. Don&#8217;t starve yourself, but cut back a bit and over time you will lose the weight!!</p>
<p>Good luck!! Please check back with us and let us know your progress!!</p>

			<p>@agentsully &#8212; Thank you for your response. I took your advice and have stayed away from the scale. In the last month I significantly changed my eating habits and read and record all my caloric and fat intake but because I have chosen healthy food and eat small meals and snacks throughout the day I&#8217;ve noticed a significant difference. I&#8217;ve fit back into my old clothes still a tad bit snug but another little bit around the butt and thighs and they will fit perfect again. My body has toned quite a bit again using free weights, elastics and yoga mainly plus doing a lot of dancing since it&#8217;s more enjoyable then just the trainer equipment. I haven&#8217;t been back on the scale but can see the results in the mirror and lost the love handle bulge with only a tiny bit left to go. My abs need a little more toning but my obliques and hips are toning nicely. I&#8217;ve been drinking alot of water and white tea with only one or two cups of coffee a day where I was drinking coffee and pop a lot through the day. It&#8217;s been a challenge not to reach for the sweets but replacing my cravings with raisins and fruit have certainly helped. I also eat the all fibre cereal instead of other ones I&#8217;d eat. It&#8217;s a little bland but putting fresh fruit in to sweeten it up in lue of sugar makes it a great filling breakfast. Great site with great information and inspiration to keep up healthy weight and eating habits.</p>

			<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I commented here about a year ago when I was at my wits end with Belly fat! so I thought I would give you an update on how I&#8217;ve been getting on!</p>
<p>I have lost LOADS! I feel GREAT and I am full of energy! But let me tell you &#8211; swimming doesn&#8217;t really work as I thought it would. It helped a wee bit but nothing major. So for most of the last year I have been swimming everyday like crazy trying to loose the flab!</p>
<p>Well I REALLY started to loose it doing weights! This is the secret! no books &#8211; no programmes &#8211; no shakes &#8211; no products! Just weight training is indeed the cure!</p>
<p>I had to move to Amsterdam after I finished college and I managed to find a small gym nearby work. They do personal training and WOW have I learned loads! Forget trying to do it yourself &#8211; it is like trying to learn Java Programming without a Computer Science degree! you might be able to get your programming running but your code will be crap and will not stand up to real world use! (yes Im a computer geek!) </p>
<p>Ok anyway, so I&#8217;ve been doing LOADS of special training, all weights and a small bit of cardio &#8211; of which I can do myself. I go twice a week for training and I run the extra day when I can to try and make it 3 times a week. I eat 6 times a day and it is fantastic! I am also vegetarian so I had to get help with that and now it&#8217;s fab!</p>
<p>So guys don&#8217;t loose hope! I&#8217;m proof it works!<br />

			<p>@Joe &#8211; Good for you! Keep at it. Something I&#8217;ve noticed, that I should probably add to the article is that cutting out or cutting down sugar really helps a lot. Excess sugar is converted to belly fat very fast and whenever I keep my sugar intake low, I notice it right away in the belly. Good luck in Kazakhstan. You&#8217;ll probably want to work out indoors or maybe take up chopping wood. <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>Wow enjoy Kazakhstan &#8211; what I can say however is that the belly is the hardest to go &#8211; but it goes!! My trainer told me to expect 6 months with no or little results &#8211; and then after 6 months effects will start to happen. He joked saying that people go to Personal Training in January to be fit for the beach in June &#8211; however that is actually not possible! It takes between 1 and 2 years to be flat packed &#8211; but you know &#8211; it all starts with today! And it&#8217;s an investment in health &#8211; and looks! So it&#8217;s worth it!! </p>
<p>I give myself treats for it all &#8211; like I went to Budapest last weekend just to relax and chill in the natural outdoor thermal baths &#8211; last year I did that and I felt fat! now I felt great!!! and I know each time I visit those baths I will look flatter each time <img src='http://lifelearningtoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>You can also further lose that belly fat if you have regular intake of food which have vitamins B5, B6 and Vitamin C.<br />
Those aid in the thyroid hormone production, fat burning and metabolism of your body.</p>
<p>You can also do various types of sit ups continuously to build that muscle fiber in the tummy area. First do three types, if you think you can do four, then add a variation and so on.</p>

			<p>This is a very informative site! Water is the most important part of our diet because it&#8217;s very safe for our system. Plus, it makes up 70% of our body. It never crossed my mind that meditation can help us out in getting that fat off of us.<br />
No stress is synonymous to a balanced life. A balanced life is synonymous to a healthy body. Great article</p>
<p>If you want to lose that fat, don&#8217;t lose hope. Just set your mind that I want to do this, and go on a diet.</p>
<p>P.S. DON&#8217;T DO CRASH DIET PLEASE!</p>

			<p>@Property Finders &#8211; Yes fat cells die off just like any other cell through the normal cell cycle. However, excess eating causes them to increase in size and not in the amount of cells. Proper diet and exercise does not cause them to die but rather to decrease in size. Once you gain the initial weight it becomes much easier to gain it back. This is because the cells are already primed to increase in size and store additional fat.</p>

			<p>Gwendolyn &#8211; in the simplest terms, count your calories religiously and make sure that you have a deficit of calories each day. (burn more than you consume). If you exercise daily you can eat more calories, but you really need to track your calories carefully. A 30 minute jog will burn about 300 calories. That doesn&#8217;t give you much extra food that you can eat- only about 1/2 a muffin. Choose your foods wisely. Stick to fruit instead of other desserts. Reduce or eliminate sugar and processed food. Wishing you much success!</p>

			<p>@Mel &#8211; first check with your doctor to make sure you&#8217;re in good health for exercise. Then consistently get 20-30 minutes of exercise (ok&#8217;d by your doctor) and try to eat whole foods as opposed to processed foods. Processed foods are metabolized differently than whole foods. Eat less calories than your body uses each day. (check with your doctor for what a good number is for you) Be patient, stick with this and you will begin to see some progress. You can do it!</p>

			<p>@Farah &#8211; to lose any fat, you must have a deficit of calories each day: burn more than you take in. Do this every day consistently and you will lose fat. Exercise helps make this easier to achieve by giving you more calories you can eat and also, if you are gaining muscle, you will increase your metabolism that will also allow  you to eat more. </p>
<p>But the main key is you must count your calories in very diligently and do it each day. See my other post on this:<br />

			<p>@Jacquie &#8211; as I understand it, it really depends on a lot of factors: your age, how much weight you are losing, how long you were at your heavy weight, and how fast you lose the weight. I believe the slower you lose the weight the more likely your skin is to shrink back.<br />
You can always loose weight, fat, and belly fat. The key is net calories. Excericse helps keep your daily net calories in below your metabolic rate. Keep it simple, keep it unemotional.<br />
Just do it, step by step, little by little and you will get there.<br />
Don&#8217;t worry about the skin until after you&#8217;re finished. Don&#8217;t let that stop you from trying.<br />
Wishing you all the best!</p>
