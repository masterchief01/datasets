<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/12/peanut-butter-cookies/" title="peanut butter cookies"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2251/2110316583_56b31fe971.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="peanut butter cookies" /></a></p>
People often ask Alex and me if it is difficult living near a trendy NYC bakery, the kind with the mind-bogglingly long cupcake lines outside at what seems like all hours. It probably would be if I found their generic cupcakes, brownies and cheesecakes more tempting but come on, this is <i>me</i> and you just know I think I make these better in my tiny kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2111094956/" title="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2106/2111094956_b0370f6349.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, this completely excludes their peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, a recipe I have been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/643811275/">promising</a> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/01/take-my-wife">you I&#8217;d</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/803028116/">conquer</a> for so long, I can&#8217;t believe you all haven&#8217;t organized a mutiny yet in disgust&#8211;especially when you learn that the recipe had been at my fingertips the whole time, it just hadn&#8217;t occurred to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2111095042/" title=" peanut butter chocolate chip cookies "><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2273/2111095042_b5d33357a1_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt=" peanut butter chocolate chip cookies " /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2110316359/" title=" peanut butter chocolate chip cookies "><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/2110316359_489428269f_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies" /></a></p>
<p>It circles back to so much of what I just don&#8217;t *get* about these trendy bakeries. Their recipes are so generic&#8211;1-2-3-4 cupcakes with back-of-the-box butter cream frosting; chocolate chip cookies not any better than Toll House; Hello Dolly bars that they neither invented nor make better than the least baking-inclined person you&#8217;ve ever met&#8211;I fail to see what&#8217;s queue-forming worthy about them. [Then again, I don't believe in waiting on a line for anything in a city this big, and oh, I bake regularly at home, so of <i>course</i> I don't get it. But I digress.] </p>
<p>Not only are the baked goods unoriginal, there is a veritable family tree of bakeries simply stealing their former employer&#8217;s recipes and shop look-feel. </p>
<p><span id="more-381"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2110316423/" title="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2152/2110316423_d570448c92.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies" /></a></p>
<p>Adam Sternbergh at <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/food/features/14289/">New York Magazine</a> sums it up well: </p>
<blockquote><p>Together, [Jennifer] Appel and a high-school friend, Allysa Torey, begat Magnolia Bakery in 1996. When their partnership, and friendship, dissolved in 1999, Magnolia begat Buttercup. In 2003, Magnolia begat Billy&#8217;s, a bakery in Chelsea, opened by a former Magnolia manager, and Buttercup begat Sugar Sweet Sunshine, started by two former Buttercup employees. Now there are at least a half-dozen similar bakeries throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, with such jolly names as Baked, Happy Happy Happy, Polka Dot Cake Studio, and Cupcake Caboose (an all-cupcake catering company), each serving up cupcakes topped with dollops of sugary frosting swirled artfully like beehive hairdos. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2110316475/" title="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2285/2110316475_446e335867.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies" /></a></p>
<p>Within this lies my &#8220;duh!&#8221; moment. If Billy&#8217;s&#8211;the bakery with the coveted peanut butter cookies&#8211;is a semi-replica of Magnolias, then odds are that the peanut butter cookies I adore so much came from there as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2110316683/" title="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2055/2110316683_cf3e60e501.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="peanut butter chocolate chip cookies" /></a></p>
<p>A quick skim of the Magnolia Bakery Cookbook confirmed these suspicions. A quick batch of these allowed me to&#8211;at last&#8211;fulfill my promise of this recipe to you, and fill our bellies with so much peanut butter, it may have been safer when we had to wait on line to get one. </p>
<p>But you won&#8217;t hear me complain that we&#8217;ll never have to again.</p>

<p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/gutted-and-glutted/">Braised Beef Short Ribs, Potato Latkes</a> 
<p><b>Peanut Butter Cookies</b><br />
Adapted from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684859106?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0684859106">Magnolia Bakery Cookbook</a></p>
<p>The brilliance of these cookies is that they have include two different formats for peanuts&#8211;three if you use chunky peanut butter. They&#8217;re crisp on the outside, and almost cakey on the inside. Bake a batch and then hide the results in the furthest and most forgettable reaches of your kitchen. You&#8217;ll thank me later. </p>
<p>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br />
3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened<br />
1 cup peanut butter at room temperature (smooth is what we used, but I am pretty sure they use chunky at the bakery)<br />
3/4 cup sugar<br />
1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar<br />
1 large egg, at room temperature<br />
1 tablespoon milk<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
1/2 cup peanut butter chips<br />
1/2 cup chocolate chips</p>
<p>For sprinkling: 1 tablespoon sugar, regular or superfine</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the flour, the baking soda, the baking powder, and the salt. Set aside.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, beat the butter and the peanut butter together until fluffy. Add the sugars and beat until smooth. Add the egg and mix well. Add the milk and the vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and beat thoroughly. Stir in the peanut butter and chocolate chips. Place sprinkling sugar &#8212; the remaining tablespoon &#8212; on a plate. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls into the sugar, then onto ungreased cookie sheets, leaving several inches between for expansion. Using a fork, lightly indent with a crisss-cross pattern (I used the back of a small offset spatula to keep it smooth on top), but do not overly flatten cookies. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake. Cookies may appear to be underdone, but they are not.</p>
<p>Cool the cookies on the sheets for 1 minute, then remove to a rack to cool completely.</p>

				<p>Mmmm, these look incredibly yumtastic. It&#8217;s a shame that I have this amazing ability to turn a good recipe to utter crap, but I&#8217;m going to try it anyway. </p>
<p>And as a fellow New Yorker I can&#8217;t understand those crazy bakery lines either, despite the fact that I can&#8217;t bake to save my life.</p>

				<p>i lived 2 blocks from magnolia in law school, and i agree that their cookies were delicious.  their cupcakes were too, of course, but i mostly only went there when i had out of town friends visiting, or when it was raining/snowing/2 pm on a tuesday/anything that meant there wouldn&#8217;t be a line. :-)</p>

				<p>These are gorgeous photos &#8212; I always try to take photos of my cookies but they never quite turn out that well!  I don&#8217;t usually use chocolate chips in my pb cookies but, um, now I think I have to.  Yum.</p>

				<p>these look fabulous but i actually need to comment about the rugelach pinwheels. i made them last night, struggled a wee-bit with rolling out the dough, but well worth it. they solicited a this from the boy: &#8220;you&#8217;re a great baker! these taste like fresh bakery cookies!&#8221;. they were supposed to be good-neighbor cookies, but we ate most of them&#8230;..score! thanks for another beauty!</p>

<p>David, not sure where you are but check the same aisle with chocolate chips. Look for REESE&#8217;S Peanut Butter Chips.</p>

				<p>OH these cookies do sound heavenly.  I&#8217;ve got to stop baking!  I&#8217;m gaining too much weight!  My family, well my husband won&#8217;t touch the stuff, my son never gains a pound, and my daughter is like me&#8230;gaining gaining gaining.  But it is so fun to bake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was thinking I wanted to make every recipe, in order, from the Dorie Greenspan BAKING book.  But that&#8217;s just copying the Julia/Julie story.  I&#8217;d only be doing it for myself anyway.</p>

				<p>Hi<br />
Love your site and check it out every day.<br />
I have one question regarding cranberry sauce served with a turkey &#8211; is is traditionally served hot or cold? </p>
<p>My mother has been cooking turkey on Christmas Eve for almost 20 years but we never tried the cranberries with it, and as I just saw the most gorgeous fresh cranberries in my local supermarket I want to try to spice up our christmas tradition with a little twist.<br />
Thanx AÃƒÂ°alheiÃƒÂ°ur from Iceland</p>

				<p>thank you for posting this!  i cant wait to try out the recipe!<br />
it&#8217;s funny- i&#8217;ve been on several cupcake taste testings and still haven&#8217;t found one that I like.  The cupcakes at billy&#8217;s were super stale :( </p>
<p>I think that making food in bulk (like they do at all the bakeries) gets you further and further from the wholesome goodness you can find in a simple apartment kitchen.  Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>Oh, yes I have the same question as to the type of peanut butter used. I usually buy the sugar-free natural stuff, but will that affect the overall sweetness too much (ie- not enough)? I&#8217;m okay with buying the creamier, sweeter kinds if that&#8217;s going to be the kicker for these cook-sters. Just wondering if it matters!</p>

				<p>My peanut butter standby (you would be positively shocked to taste how yummy these are): 1 cup sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, 1 egg. Mix together thoroughly. Preheat oven to 350. Bake for 5-6 minutes (they will not feel done) and let cool.</p>
<p>Remove the flour and all you&#8217;re left with is peanut butter!!</p>

				<p>If Billy&#8217;s makes them like Magnolia did (used to work there), they don&#8217;t use chunky PB, they use smooth and add chopped peanuts to the cookie dough.  I agree these are addictively delicious.</p>

				<p>For those wondering about the peanut butter, you should absolutely use store-bought, unnatural stuff a la Jif or Skippy. The hydrogenation is important for the cookies&#8217; texture. (signed &#8220;been there, made that mistake&#8221;)</p>

				<p>I just made them, and they are delicious!  I think their small size (I tend to want to make huge cookies) is important to their texture.  Next time I might try mini chocolate chips, because the big Ghiradelli chips that I used didn&#8217;t distribute very evenly, and some cookies were left with no chocolate at all.  </p>
<p>Thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>I made these last night when I got home from work and they look beautiful and taste good.  I think I may have made a mistake though, I used bakers sugar (extra fine) instead of regular white sugar and the cookies are almost too sweet.  Should I have not made the replacement?</p>

				<p>Ok &#8211; I just made them and this is the perfect batter base (before adding chips) for a delicious peanutbutter cookie!! I added just 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips as I just wanted a hint of chocolate. I also added 1/4 cup chopped salted peanuts rather than pb chips and it gave that extra peanutiness! Mmm mmm good! Next time I think I will leave out the extra sprinkle of sugar as it was just a tad too sugary for my liking. Thanks again!</p>

				<p>Amazing cookies.  Because of Janna&#8217;s post above, I made mine with half mini-chips and half regular chips and it was perfect.  The best part &#8212; they were stupid easy to make!  I was a bit worried about making the dough because I blew up my hand mixer earlier in the week making sugar cookie dough so I had to do it by hand &#8212; not even a little bit of a problem!

				<p>charlotte s &#8212; Definitely think you could use chunky peanut butter. You could easily replace the peanut butter chips with a) more chocolate chips, b) some other type of chip you might like or c) if you&#8217;re daring, some chopped peanut butter candy. If it is frozen, it might be easier to chop&#8211;I&#8217;m thinking peanut butter cups or something like that. Good luck!</p>
<p>Adam R, Laura W, Margot &#8212; On my own, I use all sorts of natural/organic/hippy stuff. However, for baking, I think that Jiffy/Skippy/Peter Pan, etc. (god, are these brands still around? I feel terrifically old) are the safest, because they&#8217;re the most consistent in flavor/texture. </p>
<p>Ann &#8212; Butterscotch gingerbread? I haven&#8217;t been in ages&#8211;guess why? Yup, because I have cracked the peanut butter cookie code and no longer need them&#8211;but I must check that out. I&#8217;ll see what I can come up with.   </p>
<p>tracy &#8212; I completely agree, and find Billy&#8217;s cupcakes to be especially and consistently stale. I cannot for the life of me understand why they don&#8217;t do better QT on them. Even Magnolia got the moist cake issue down! I digress&#8211;things are infinitely better in small batches from your own apartment, always. You never have to compromise flavor or quality for consistency and budget reasons.</p>
<p>janna  &#8212; Agreed. I used the Ghiradelli chips and since I like cookies very small, they were very dominating. However, when I have a few extra minutes, I prefer hand-chopped chocolate to chips any day&#8211;fewer stabilizers, better flavor and exactly the size you need every time!</p>
<p>Andrea &#8212; Sadly, I never counted. Of course, I make cookies really tiny so my count might not be helpful for others. I&#8217;ll try to check next time!</p>
<p>Elaine &#8212; Because extra fine sugar is so, uh, extra fine (don&#8217;t know why that made me giggle&#8211;it&#8217;s late!) it is possible that you&#8217;d end up with more sugar in the same volume thus extra sweetness. But these are a definitely sweet cookie. I didn&#8217;t think cloyingly so, but certainly no minimal shortbread. If you want to cut down on the sweetness next time, you can simply sprinkle a little sugar over them at the end instead, and not roll the whole cookie in it&#8211;should make a noticeable difference.</p>
<p>Corinne, Joycelyn &#8212; Not sure what went wrong, but it definitely sounds like something did. These cookies spread for me, but barely, which is why they need to be pressed a little on top. I am wondering if you were a little short on flourÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ If nothing else, chilling the batter for a little time before scooping might keep it from spreading as much&#8211;if nothing else, gives you a cleaner scoop. However, I made batches with room temperature dough and frozen dough and neither spread for me.</p>

				<p>I cannot express in words how much I love you for this recipe. Haha. I&#8217;m serious! I&#8217;m hopelessly addicted to peanut butter, really beyond all reason, and I can&#8217;t wait to make these cookies. I just moved to NYC, and am bummed that there is no such thing as a sleepy, local bakery to be found (at least, I haven&#8217;t found one yet). I like to bake for myself anyhow, but I&#8217;ve never been able to settle on a really satisfying PBcookie recipe before. Thank you! This one looks so terrific. I bet you will see the results (I&#8217;ll give you full credit for tipping me off to the recipe, of course) on my site in a few days.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a little confused about the sprinkling part. Do I use 1 tablespoon of sugar for each &#8216;teaspoon&#8217; of dough? Or do I use the 3/4 cup + 1 teaspon sugar for dipping the whole cookie dough in it? Gonna try this tomorrow since it looks fairly simple to do. Would appreciate your help. Thanks.</p>

				<p>I have just found this blog&#8230; OMG my life has been soooo empty! This has got to be the best blog in the world!! I have a question though&#8230; What on earth are PB chips???  have never heard of them here in New Zealand. I love what I have seen of your recipes so far (only four) I have no interest in dinner or lunch, just dessert and other sweet things&#8230;  no wonder I cannot loose weight.</p>

				<p>I made these cookies yesterday afternoon while my sons slept. These are the best PB cookies anyone in my family have ever had and I was told numerous times to keep the recipe forever. I made a double batch and ended up with roughly 4 dozen cookies when using half a regular ice cream scoop. I also omitted the PB chips and used chopped chocolate instead of chips.<br />
<a href="http://runawayoctober.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/peanut-butter-cookies/" rel="nofollow"><br />
Here&#8217;s my blog post about them. </a></p>
<p>Yum! Thanks for the recipe!<br />

				<p>thank you- I hate pb cookie recipes where there is an equal amount of butter (or even shortening- ick)  it totaly dilutes the pb flavor, and isn&#8217;t that the point?</p>
<p>peanut butter cookies should taste like peanut butter.  i made these without either chips and they came out just fine- yummy base.  I&#8217;m thinking it would be yummy with white choc chips and raisins, like a PB&amp;J sandwich cookie- hafta try soon.</p>

				<p>Wow. These cookies are deadly!!</p>
<p>Next time I might omit the sprinkling sugar..though I suspect it may be an important part of the nice outer texture&#8230;and will definitely add in some chopped peanuts. Even using crunchy peanut butter I think a few larger chunks of peanuts would be great.</p>

				<p>I made these today, lactose free even ;)</p>
<p>I used Fleischmann&#8217;s unsalted margarine (soy based) and omitted the milk, substituting extra vanilla. I skipped the chips entirely (to keep them milk free) and these are amazing, thank you for sharing! When I took the first batch out of the oven, they were beautiful! I even did the the traditional fork criss-cross, and they didn&#8217;t fall apart like some recipes, even though I really lay on the outer coating of sugar (my favorite part). Thanks again!</p>
<p>Also the OH appreciates cookies he can eat that the answer to &#8220;Is there milk in this?&#8221; is &#8220;Nope!&#8221; I appreciate something basic enough that I can adapt to make us both happy.^^</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t you astounded by the sheer volume of us that don&#8217;t have a fall-to peanut butter cookie recipe? Hooray for the internet!</p>

				<p>I was SO disappointed by Magnolia. Especially after working at Sprinkles Cupcakes. The long line was expected, but something is hygenically wrong with the &#8220;serve yourself&#8221; atmosphere, along with the ridiculous prices. Sprinkles has very strict rules on customer service and packaging cupcakes. Magnolia was just a complete letdown on many levels.</p>

				<p>I baked these cookies for Valentines to the delight of my roommates, classmates, and my guy.  They were such a big hit!  I used natural PB (the texture was still great) and mini dark chocolate chunks.  I also advise making them small and not omitting the sugar sprinkling- they look like little gems!  </p>
<p>Thanks so much for the recipe.  I&#8217;ll definitely be baking more of your concoctions!</p>

				<p>Oh my these look incredible. I make the <a href="http://peanutbutterboy.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies</a> which only use 3-ingredients, but these look ridiculous. A little more involved, sure, but where do you use the chocolate chips? Clearly they are inside, are they just put into the center of each cookie? That looks like an incredible way to bake them, I&#8217;m excited for my next batch! Thanks!</p>

				<p>I have made this recipe twice.  Once, because I am always on the lookout for a good PB cookie, and the second time because OMG!!!! I could not stop thinking about these cookies after the first batch was gone.</p>
<p>I used hippy dippy peanut butter and it worked fine.  I did find my cookies were especially crumbly, and also very fluffy &#8211; the criss-cross disappeared completely and they puffed up considerably.  Maybe I&#8217;ll try decreasing the leavening?  I actually found that this recipe seems especially suited to giant cookies &#8211; the kind you find in a bakery.  They maintain the great crispy/soft texture that is hard to get in giant cookies.</p>

				<p>Very yummy, with or without the chocolate chips! I used Smucker&#8217;s Natural peanut butter, and that added a very pleasant texture to the cookies. It&#8217;s &#8220;creamy&#8221; on the label, though in my book it is not truly creamy.</p>

				<p>this recipe is amazing! me and my guys just polished off 15 cookies right out of the oven, and it is just like the picture, delicious, crunchy on the outside and moist in the center. i would recommend using semi sweet or dark chocolate chips because the dough is very sweet. at any rate i give the recipe A++ and the best part is you really feel like an artisan preparing and serving these cookies</p>

				<p>I am a cookie snob.  Just made these.  Holy cow!  This is a keeper recipe.  I don&#8217;t need to look further.  I doubled the recipe, added more vanilla because I always do.  Great cookies.</p>

				<p>I made these cookies last night and by accident used 2 sticks of butter instead of 1.  Let me tell you they were AMAZING! They spread quite a bit more as the dough was somewhat softer, but tasted fabulous, and even the next day they were still soft and chewy (and I didn&#8217;t even cover them up&#8230;). We ate them in record time and I&#8217;ll be making more&#8230;YUM!</p>

				<p>I made these cookies this weekend. They are truly wonderful and loved by all taste buds! I was tempted to use my regular natural peanut butter, but used Skippy (or similar) as suggested. I also chopped up my chocolate from a bulk bar. I put the dough in the fridge for 20 mins before rolling them and baking them off &#8211; I think this helped he spreading problem. I will make these for ever&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

				<p>Oh my! These are possibly the best cookies I&#8217;ve ever baked (and I&#8217;m not even that big a fan of peanuts.) For extra oomph, I used super chunky peanut butter and added 1/2 C of chopped peanuts. I made them small and rolled in a mix of raw and cane sugar. Delicious! Thanks so much, Deb!</p>

				<p>Just made these, and they are scrumptious!!  </p>
<p>Note to other readers: I like my cookies crispy, so I let them cook until they were JUST starting to brown on the edges.  They were crispy all the way through, even in the middle.  Perfect for me!  If you want a softer cookie, take them out as directed.  They wont seem done (may even jiggle a little), but once out of the oven, they harden up.    </p>
<p>Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  Definitely a keeper.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these twice in less than 2 weeks&#8230;soooooooo delish.  Made 2nd batch with whole wheat flour (mostly to feel less guilty about eating them for breakfast)&#8230;sifted dry ingredients 3 (or 4) times, I lost count, but still taste great.  Also, did 10 minutes only, and am at high altitude (Colorado) and didn&#8217;t adjust the recipe at all. Yum</p>

I&#8217;ve been threatening to do it for months&#8230; you see, it was also my first foray into baking anything.  Ever.  So thank you Deb for posting something so simple and delicious that also made me feel accomplished.  I did it!  I baked cookies!  :D</p>

				<p>Oh my, these are so yummy!  I didn&#8217;t have peanut butter chips at home, so I used  a total of 3/4 cup of Ghiradelli chocolate chips instead.  I made one dozen without sugar coating and I think that was a mistake.  </p>
<p>Making these small is perfect!  They melt in your mouth and are so much lighter than a normal peanut butter cookie.</p>

				<p>I made these last weekend as a pre-Thanksgiving treat. They were so delicious and pretty. I used Whole Foods peanut butter. They have it now in a hydrogenated, all-natural version (is such a thing possible?) and it made me feel slightly more self-righteous than if I&#8217;d used Jiff or Skippy.<br />
I put the dough in the fridge for about an hour before I spooned it out. That made it really easy to handle.<br />
Thanks for being the best food-blog around!</p>

				<p>I just made these with chunky pb and chopped Ghirardelli 60% chips- outstanding! I had the same flat cookie issue that others have mentioned, but I like my cookies crispy so no problem. I rolled half in the sugar and sprinkled the other half with sea salt instead. I liked the salted ones far better and would highly recommend this variation for folks that don&#8217;t like things too sweet.</p>

My boyfriend &#8211; who LOATHES peanut butter cookies &#8211; ate four within the first couple of hours of their coming out of the oven.  Best peanut butter cookies I&#8217;ve ever had, hands-down.  And so easy!!</p>

				<p>Thanks for another great recipe! A couple things I noticed. </p>
<p>In the recipe you say to add the &#8220;sugars&#8221; to the mix. The plurality confused me a little since the only sugar in the actual recipe was the brown sugar. The white sugar was for rolling. I had to read it a couple times to be sure I wasn&#8217;t missing something. Am I wrong? Also, you never mention in the recipe to incorporate the chocolate chips, just the peanut butter chips. I figured they just went in with the PB chips. As someone who has messed up far too many recipes by not reading it thoroughly or missing a step, I&#8217;ve finally learned to be more careful, but I still need things spelled out for me. Haven&#8217;t developed my bakers intuition just yet. Thanks for such a great website!!!</p>

				<p>these are so good. very greasy but delicious! I made ice cream sandwiches with these with haagen-daz ice cream- it was surreal! I also used natural paenut butter and did not add peanut butter chips! I dipped it in sugar and it made it glisten! love it! I also did the red velvet and it taste as good as box cake! love this site. the pics are gorgeous!</p>

				<p>Your recipe is very close to the cookbook one in the Buttercup Bakes at Home Cookbook I recently found at the library. They called them Drizzled Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk Cookies. They are excellent cookies!</p>

				<p>I made these last weekend, just half a batch because there&#8217;s only 3 of us and we tend to power through the sweets. I did not use peanut butter chips at all, just lots of yummy chocolate chips. I also used half smooth, half chunky; both Skippy brand. I also never use unsalted butter, so I skimped a bit on added salt. I&#8217;m interested about the effect of Skippy-type PB vs. no-sugar-added PB on the flavor.<br />
In any event, they came out bangin&#8217;. The granular sugar on the outside gave it a delicious sweet, crunchy outside with a fluffy, not-too-dry interior. Seriously, do not overbake them! They were Mary Poppins: Practically Perfect in Every Way.</p>

				<p>I love cookies. I mean really love cookies. Chocolate cake? No thanks. Cheesecake? Meh. But gimme a chocolate chip cookie for dessert and I&#8217;m in heaven! How can it be then, that I hate peanut butter cookies?! Maybe because all the ones in bakeries are giant and dense and just generally blah. Oh, and they have no chocolate. Not so with these!! They are fabulous! Crunchy on the outside chewy in the middle with just the right amount of PB and chocolate. My husband is so happy because PB cookies are his favorite and I&#8217;ve always refused to make them. Thanks! Recipe notes: I followed the recipe to the letter, using Simply Jif and mini chocolate chips. Yum! And they look EXACTLY like the picture (an amazing feat for a not so amazing baker!) Thanks!</p>

				<p>hi deb,</p>
<p>agree with your assessment on designer cupcakes. additionally, i find that the boutique-y cupcakes tend to have waaaaaay too much frosting. i&#8217;m not a fan of equal parts frosting &amp; cake. i&#8217;m a cake girl, so i like that to take center stage in the flavor/texture dept.</p>
<p>anyway, i recently (and happily) came across your site. being a fan of witty repartee &amp; baking/cooking, i am enjoying your posts.</p>
<p>my main reason for scanning your site yesterday was to find a fun way to dispense with the chocolate-almond ganache leftover from making my friend, laura, mini chocolate almond cupcakes for her b-day last week. i knew i had about another week before it would go bad, so the pressure was on. my concept: peanut butter/chocolate sandwich cookies. i searched on a few food sites for recipes, but decided yours was the one i HAD to try.</p>
<p>YUM!</p>
<p>i made the cookies (sorta) small as per your advise. probably somewhere between a teaspoon &amp; tablespoon of dough&#8230;.used a melon ball scooper for size-consistency). for those who asked, this yielded about 6 dozen cookies. </p>
<p>my 1970s oven baked them fast &#8212; about 7-8 minutes. i have a thermometer in there, and it DID read 350°, but doubt that i should trust its accuracy.</p>
<p>i used trader joe&#8217;s organic chunky peanut butter &#8212; i mixed &amp; refrigerated it overnight FIRST, so it wasn&#8217;t separated, plus it had a thicker consistency after being chilled.</p>
<p>i left out the peanut butter chips (even though i LOVE them), just because this recipe called for more peanut butter than any other one i&#8217;d seen. figured i could add them next time to compare&#8230; BTW, wondering what the 3rd &#8216;peanut format&#8217; is that you mention in the beginning?<br />
i almost omitted the choc chips since they would be slathered with ganache later&#8230;.but self-control went out the window, so the chips didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>after the cookies cooled, i spread the underside of a cookie with semi-softened (but not runny) ganache, then took another cookie and made a sandwich. i chilled them in the fridge for 30-40 minutes minimum to set the chocolate, but of course sampled a couple warm. :-)</p>
<p>one other note &#8212; i used regular granulated sugar (not superfine) for sprinkling, and found that it dissolved pretty much on contact&#8230;would you recommend coarse sugar? i often use the &#8217;sugar in the raw&#8217; for pre-baking sprinkling.</p>
<p>anyway, will post pics to my facebook profile later. if you&#8217;d like to see, lemme know.</p>
<p>sorry for the lengthy post!</p>
<p>thanx!!!!<br />

				<p>I just made your peanut butter cookies this afternoon. I used mostly crunchy peanut butter with just a little creamy but omitted the chocolate and peanut butter chips. Everyone in my family loved them. This was exactly what we&#8217;ve been looking for a cookie that is chewy.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these with all chocolate chips, and without any chips, and either way, they are delicious. (I also tend to prefer an unsugared cookie, since sugaring peanut butter cookies seems like gilding the lily, to me.)<br />
This is a great recipe! Thanks for sharing, Deb!</p>

				<p>The first time I baked these, I used some &#8220;healthy&#8221; lower sugar peanut butter that I must have bought in a moment of insanity.  Also used the mini chips.  They were good but my No. 1 peanut butter cookie taster didn&#8217;t think they were sweet enough.  Today, I made them with good old Peter Pan chunky and 1 cup of regular chocolate chips and they attained OMG status.  My plan was to take the batch to new neighbors but &#8230;  This is our pnut btr cookie recipe for life!</p>

				<p>This is the quintessential chocolate peanut butter cookie recipe. Thank you. My oven is sassy so she finished the baking process in only 8 minutes which made her impatient feeder quite happy.  I accidentally poured in too much salt ( all that was on hand was sea salt and the cover is caved in from being hit angrily with a fork ). But the saltiness actually worked. It gave it nice aftertaste once the sweetness hit the tongue. The size and shape and texture are perfect and they will be even more delicious tomorrow.</p>

				<p>Made these for a housewarming party last night.  Rave reviews.  They thought I stopped by a bakery on my way there. :) I love the spatula imprint as opposed to the traditional fork.  And the bit of sea salt I threw on when the cookies were just out of the oven really did for me.  Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>Oh I think I might have made myself sick. I just took the last tray out of the oven, having sampled liberally from each one. They are perfect in every way, but I particularly love the texture. They are possibly the best cookies I&#8217;ve ever eaten, and almost definitely the best ones I&#8217;ve ever made. Oh yes, being in Europe, there are no peanut butter chips, so I went with a mix of the only two kinds of &#8216;chip&#8217; available&#8211;milk choc and &#8216;plain&#8217; choc. Used crunchy peanut butter labelled &#8216;American style&#8217;. Think I&#8217;ll convert a few Europeans with these!</p>

				<p>been a silent following for ages but had to comment on these cos they were soooo super good!!</p>
<p>just made a batch and they lasted less than 15mins amongst my housemates :)<br />
i reduced the sugar in the batter and didnt do the sugar coating either..<br />
and if only we had peanut butter chips here down in australia&#8230;</p>
<p>despite being someone who super RARELY repeats recipes, this recipe is definitely a keeper&#8230;</p>

				<p>Did you use an all-natural pb or something like Skippy? Did you make any changes to the recipe? Was your kitchen especially warm? Always hard to guess what&#8217;s going on if I&#8217;m not in the kitchen with you, but any of these things can throw a recipe a little.</p>

				<p>I would love to make these cookies &#8211; they sound delicious. One question I do have&#8230;can I go without or substitute the milk? I cook more than I bake &#8211; so I&#8217;m not sure how the milk affects the recipe as a whole. I don&#8217;t normally buy milk and it&#8217;d be nice to avoid buying a container of it for just one tablespoon. But if I&#8217;ll have to&#8230;then I&#8217;ll have to!

				<p>This recipe makes the best peanut butter cookies I have EVER had, although I skip the peanut butter chips.  When I pull them out of the oven, I sprinkle a little more sea salt onto them &#8211; amazing.  Question &#8211; I want to make these for a trip that we are taking at the end of next week.  Do you think that this dough could be frozen?  If not, how long do you think it could be refrigerated before baking?  I am trying to slowly prepare food ahead of time that we can cook/bake after we arrive at our destination.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t usually refrigerate dough for more than a day but I freeze it all of the time. Well-wrapped, you can keep it for weeks, bake pieces off as you need them. Which &#8212; who are we kidding &#8212; is always.</p>

				<p>Wow! These cookies are phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been bored during the summer holidays &amp; thought, I&#8217;ll do some baking. I&#8217;ve just made these cookies &amp; they are sooo good! I substituted peanut butter chips with slightly crushed peanuts as they don&#8217;t sell peanut butter chips in Scotland :&#8217;(, but they still taste fantastic! x</p>

				<p>I made these yesterday and OH MY they are absolutely heavenly! I made my husband take what was still left to work with him because I knew I&#8217;d sit here all day eating away at them. I didn&#8217;t have any peanut butter chips on hand, so I replaced them with semi sweet chocolate chips and the cookies turned out great! I love the extra chocolate in there. :) Thanks for another great recipe, Deb!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!  I&#8217;ve made a few recipes from your site and all of them have come out delicious!  I made these cookies tonight, but they didn&#8217;t come out looking like the ones in your photos.  Mine came out fat. :(  The cookie dough was kind of runny, so I put it in the freezer for a bit before portioning them out and baking them.  It helped a little, but still came out flat.  Any advice?</p>

				<p>ive made these cookies a handful of times by now and have yet to hear anything other than, &#8220;oh my god i LOVE these cookies&#8221;. i stick to the recipe for the most part, using creamy peanut butter and reeses peanut butter chips, but i omit the chocolate chips and i use dark brown sugar rather than light brown sugar. not sure how different the taste would be with light, but i like the molasses taste of the dark. thanks for sharing this five-star recipe. wins every time!</p>

				<p>made these last night&#8230;.. after doing a search for THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES.  i used the 1/2 cup choc chips, but instead of peanut butter chips, i diced 4 reeses peanut butter cups.  i also kept the sugar coated dough balls really &#8220;tall&#8221; to make fat cookies, chilled them in the fridge a bit before baking, and lightly tapped the tops with my potato masher to give them a cool waffle print.  they are FANTASTIC.  my new favorite recipe.  thank you!!</p>

				<p>i love your blog and follow it already, but when i did a search for the best peanutbutter chocolate cookies, it came right to you! should have known! however, i wonder if the batter shouldn&#8217;t be chilled prior to baking so that the traditional little cross hatching on the cookie tops comes through and they don&#8217;t get too thin</p>

				<p>Just had to say how fantastically delicious these are, Deb.  Like many, my cookies are not as puffy as yours, but I think if I chill them next time overnight this will be rectified.  I didn&#8217;t have peanut butter chips so I doubled the chocolate, and in addition to rolling them in sugar sprinkled sea salt across the tops before baking.  The result is indescribably good &#8211; these are so rich and delicious that I don&#8217;t know if I can even handle more than one at a time without swooning.</p>

				<p>Sigh.  I can&#8217;t make anything BUT these cookies and the peanut butter brownies now.  I&#8217;ve gained 20 pounds in the past few months &#8211; not even kidding.  They&#8217;re so good, and I have no self-control.  I think I&#8217;m going to try forming them into balls and then freezing them so I can pull out 3 at a time or whatever to see if that helps.  Of course, it&#8217;s just as easy to pull out 5, or 10&#8230;I love you&#8230;</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t really like peanut butter cookies, but I included these in a care package I sent recently and of course I had to sample some&#8230;quality control, you understand&#8230;and they were my favorite of the 4 different cookies I sent! As a matter of fact, these are now one of my favorite cookies EVER! I left out the pb chips and doubled the choc chips. After spooning out the dough for each cookie, I flattened them a bit, flash froze them, then put them in a ziploc bag with baking instructions written on it and stored them in the freezer. When I want to bake some, I just pull out however many I want&#8230;or, feel comfortable eating at one time&#8230;sprinkle them with coarse salt and sugar, and bake them. FANTASTIC!</p>

				<p>I made these again recently using natural peanut butter (ingredients: peanuts, salt) instead of the &#8220;unnatural&#8221; stuff, and the only difference I saw was slightly more spreading. They&#8217;re still really good, with a bit more texture.</p>

				<p>This cookies are amazing!  I made them without the chocolate chips, though.  I think that it makes them too sweet and takes away from the peanut buttery goodness.  I&#8217;m also really happy because these cookies are the closest recipe that I&#8217;ve found to tasting like the peanut butter cookies that I used to have in high school.  I think it must be the peanut butter chips.  I will definitely be making these again, and this is now *the* peanut butter recipe that I will use every time I make peanut butter cookies!  Thank you!!</p>

				<p>i have to agree with the above comment! absolutely amazing. I just made them and can scarce keep from eating them all! I too used the super fine sugar and didn&#8217;t get that cool looking crystal thing going on, would probably try a little coarser white to see if I got that look, otherwise superb. Used T.J&#8217;s smooth peanut butter and half a bag of milk chocolate chips (put through a mini processor to cut down their size) AND used salted butter as that&#8217;s all i had and they still turned out deelish! Thank you!</p>

				<p>These are terrific!  Thinking of trying an even coarser sugar, too.  I mistakenly put too many chocolate chips and the right amount of peanut butter chips and also found them delicious.  However, I want to make a plea for my dad &#8211; put the fork cross hatches on all peanut butter cookies!  He hates peanut butter but loves all other cookies and gets annoyed when this &#8216;marker&#8217; is not on them and he bites into them unawares!</p>

				<p>What beautiful and tasty cookies! I have an issue with deflated cookies and ever since I laid eyes upon that picture of  glittery chocolate-y seductive cookies I just had to try them myself. To my surprise, they came out perfectly (especially because I forgot to time them and they were done at the peak of the strong peanut aroma). Once again, Smitten kitchen has not let me down!</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t cook for anything in the world. I overcook or vaporize anything I make. I even burned a pot of water once. But I saw this and it looked so good that i had to try it, in spite of my lack of skill. And it came out delicious. I even burned the second batch, and they still tasted amazing! </p>

				<p>@Corinne &#8211; The speading likely came from using an ingredient with the wrong melting point.  Butter has a lower melting temp than margarine or Crisco, so I would guess it&#8217;s your peanut butter.  Did you use a standard grocery store peanut butter (Jif, Skippy, etc. &#8211; not low fat or anything) or did you use a natural (and perhaps looser) peanut butter?  </p>
<p>If not that, were you scooping your flour into the measuring cup with a spoon or scoop, or were you dipping the measuring cup into the flour bin and leveling it off?  If it was the former, perhaps you didn&#8217;t get enough flour in the recipe.</p>
<p>If neither of these were it, check your oven temperature.</p>

				<p>Thank you a million times for this recipe.  I was craving peanut butter cookies, found this recipe, started daydreaming about them and had to make them. Luckily, I had an excuse this week in the form of a small football-watching party.  I followed your recipe to a T, baked the cookies for 11 minutes, and oh. my. The only thing I forgot to do was the criss-cross design but I don&#8217;t think the cookies suffered for it! My husband claimed he had to &#8220;test&#8221; them before the guests arrived and all I heard from the kitchen was &#8220;These are AMAZING! Oh Wow!&#8221; This was echoed by one of my friends who informed me he was taking some home with him (after eating only one cookie) and smuggled a few into some tupperware.  This recipe is ridiculously good! Thanks for figuring it out and posting it.</p>

				<p>I know you would advise me otherwise, BUT &#8212; how much shortening should I use if I am subbing for butter? I am right there with you on the all-butter tip, it&#8217;s just that someone gave me a tub of Spectrum shortening as an Xmas gift, loves PB cookies, and is coming for dinner tomorrow. I have no choice!</p>

				<p>Amazing recipe!! Came out great with chunky PB &#8212; sort of salty, mmm. But wish I had used butter for a chewier texture. Also, I used big chunks of chocolate cut from a block to press down the cookies, so they came out more like Magic Middles.</p>

				<p>Just made these and they are to die for!  I made them on the smaller side and they were perfect!  Dough seemed a little crumbly, but the cookies came out great (maybe I should have used a scooper like in the picture). Sugar topping was a nice touch at the end.  I will be making these again!! BTW: I&#8217;ve following your blog now for a couple of months and really have enjoyed how you tweak the recipes to make an ordinary meal into a gourmet experience&#8211;Thank you!</p>

				<p>Thank you for this recipe! Just made these today and they are wonderful!</p>
<p>I could definitely get away with putting in less sugar and omit the PB chips If I wanted to feel less guilty! They are sinfully delicious! Much better than any of the cookies I&#8217;ve had from the nice bakery stores around.</p>

				<p>Didn&#8217;t use peanut butter chips, and instead used 1 cup of semi-sweet chips. Used coarse sugar to roll the cookies and it was perfect! Next time I will use bittersweet chocolate chips, as semi-sweet chips were overpowering in their sweetness next to the creamy peanut butter.</p>

				<p>I love love love these cookies.  I just made them again tonight.  I used natural peanut butter (Mara Natha, which is less dry than some natural peanut butters) and added about a tablespoon of maple syrup since the dough was a little drier and less sweet than if I had used Jif/other peanut butter.  Deeelish.  Really, what isn&#8217;t improved by the addition of maple syrup?  I also only used chocolate chips since I didn&#8217;t have peanut butter chips, and I upped the amount to 3/4 cup.  I took them out of the oven very recently&#8230; I&#8217;ve already eaten 3 and probably about to go for one more&#8230;</p>

				<p>I made this recipe with some no brainer substitutions (i.e. didn&#8217;t have milk so used yogurt, and shifted the brown/white sugar ratio) &#8212; and excluded the peanut butter chips, on principle. The end result was incredible and tasty! Not crumbly/powdery like most peanut butter cookie recipes. Thank you SK!</p>

				<p>My 1st post, saved for my 1st recipe tried from the SK!</p>
<p>The cookies are quite tasty and a nice side-step texture wise from what I consider the traditional PB cookie.   I used natural, store ground PB from Whole Foods, no chips or sprinkling sugar, dare I say they are almost healthy!  Good from the oven, better the nest day!</p>

				<p>These are the best cookies I&#8217;ve ever had.  I&#8217;ve made them twice now. The first time with semi-sweet chocolate chips and creamy peanut butter and the second with dark chocolate chips and crunchy peanut butter.  The second batch turned out better because the dark chocolate cut the sweetness a bit.  DELICIOUS!</p>

				<p>This is the BEST peanutbutter cookie recipe that I have ever used.  I like most people have modified this recipe to my personal liking.  I omitt the rolling in the sugar and peanutbutter chips and have found using Kirkland brand organic peanutbutter (Costco brand) to make the best tasting cookie.  I also use Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate chips to add even more taste.  What ever modifcations you make to this recipe it will always taste great with the 1 cup of peanutbutter and real vanilla extract.</p>

				<p>Just made these for a dairy-free friend.  I subbed oil and more peanut butter instead of butter, used dark choc chips, and omitted the pb chips.  They look just like your picture (LOVE it when that happens!)  and they taste awesome.   I always appreciate your tips such as taking the cookies out of the oven when they look not-quite-done.   That&#8217;s what makes SK special- and what you can&#8217;t get in (most) cookbooks.  (You do realise, Deb, that your archives in book form, complete with your drool-worthy photos, would sell BILLIONS&#8230;)</p>

				<p>Made these over the weekend, and they are excellent! Everything it says about crunchy on the outside while cakey inside is totally true. I didn&#8217;t have any milk on hand so I used a tablespoon of water instead. I figured it wouldn&#8217;t matter. Still turned out great.</p>

				<p>Deb- I just discovered these and made them.They were delicious, but I had a totally weird experience with them&#8230; After the dry ingredients went in the batter separated into a crumble texture. I had to press(hard) the dough into a cookie scoop in order to force the dough to come together and it was oozing oil while being pressed. Once they baked up they were delicious, but after about 30 minutes on the cooling rack they were quite crispy on the outside and downright chewy on the inside. I don&#8217;t think this is what was supposed to happen.</p>
<p>The only thing that I can think of that I did &#8220;wrong&#8221; was I used natural peanut butter. Do you think my weird experience can be attributed to that?</p>

				<p>I just made batch of these in my convection toaster oven. Due to the smaller size oven I can only bake 6 cookies at a time and there are LOTS of where the dough came from. I think I&#8217;ll be baking all night long. hahaha<br />
The cookies are of perfect texture. Soft and moist, just the way I like it. Not dry and crumbly like store bought cookies! They are so yummy but tad bit too sweet for my taste buds. Next time I will use dark chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet I used, and use a bit less of the sugar! I don&#8217;t know much about cooking and this is the first time I baked cookies in over 5 years and I was surprised at how easy it was to make them! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!</p>

				<p>My Girlfriend is allergic to peanuts but would love to eat these cookies!  So she and I made a batch without the peanut butter chips and using sunflower seed butter in place of the peanut butter.  They turned out great!  We even took them to a picnic and didn&#8217;t tell anyone that these Peanut Butter-ish cookie in fact had no peanut butter in them.  Half of them never noticed and everyone enjoyed them.  So for those with an allergy, give some sunflower seed butter a try.</p>

				<p>Wow..this entry is from back in the day!   Do you still make these?  Well, they are new to me so I made these last night.  They are probably the best PB cookies ever, according to my husband..and now me.  He is always after me to add choc chips to my recipe, but they don&#8217;t blend in as well because of all the fat in the dough, so I leave them out.  This cookie dough held onto them really well.  I liked that it used more peanut butter than butter so it had a more assertive peatnut butter flavor.   I like a crisp PB cooky, so I just baked some of them a little longer..and we are both happy!   Good recipe pick, Deb!</p>

				<p>I made these last weekend without the chocolate chips.  I had peanut butter chips and used the whole bag of those.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will only use the amount of peanut butter chips in the recipe instead of subbing more of them for the chocolate chips.  I also rolled them in organic sugar which has larger granules than the regular sugar.</p>
<p>These really are delicious and this recipe will be the new standard here.  </p>
<p>Thanx again for a great recipe! :o)</p>

				<p>Answered my own questions when I made them, ahem.  Didn&#8217;t get the peanut chips in time, so I used 1/4 cup of peanuts, 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, and made almost 60 (!!!!) cookies.  Fortunately, we found people to give them to.  Additionally, I used fresh ground peanut butter, so added a pinch more salt, and a bit more sugar as well, to account for the use of both of these ingredients in conventional PB.</p>

				<p>These cookies were divine! They are the IT peanut butter cookie, for sure. The sugar is almost like a crackly wonderful crust and hot from the oven it doesn&#8217;t get much better since they are soft and cakey, like Deb said they would be. I omitted the chocolate chips because, well, I&#8217;m a peanut butter purist sort of gal and I found I didn&#8217;t need them although, since these are sweet, I can see how it might cut through some of that better with the chocolate. Thanks for all the great recipes!</p>

I baked them on a whim (after buying the wrong kind of PB by mistake for my morning toast) in my tiny apartment kitchen, and only remembered after starting that I had no mixer or beater of any kind! Nevertheless, a set of forearms to shame Popeye later, I am well satisfied =) Thanks for the wonderful recipes!</p>

				<p>Even though it was another extremely hot day in NYC, I dared to turn on my oven and make these&#8230;delicious!  I left out the chocolate, rolled my dough into little balls, and covered with sugar before cooking.  Then afterward I put a scoop of strawberry ice cream between two cookies&#8230;et voila!  Peanut and jelly ice cream sandwich, the perfect treat!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Deb.  I turn to SmittenKitchen whenever I&#8217;m looking for the perfect treat and you have yet to fail me!!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!  I lost a bet to my husband this evening (I bet whoever could find my garlic press the baked good of their choice), so I had to find some peanut butter cookies to make.  I made these since I always check Smitten Kitchen first when looking for a new recipe, and I have a bag of peanut butter chips in the freezer waiting to be used.  Delicious!  Although I had trouble with a greasy-feeling dough crumbling and not holding on to the chips, and generally breaking apart when I tried to scoop into balls.  Baked up fine, but not as pretty or cakey as yours.  Could be the heat, could be the TJ&#8217;s natural chunky peanut butter &#8211; I&#8217;ll try again since they taste sooo good.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I have been looking for the perfect PB cookie recipe for the longest time and I have finally found it! Just baked this 2 hours ago and they are DIVINE!!! absolutely delicious. instead of the 10-12 minutes i baked them for 14-15. they&#8217;re so soft, rich, and have the perfect amount of PB taste to it&#8230; i used crunchy jiffy PB for the recipe, i think that might make a huge difference in the recipe! wonderful.</p>

				<p>Just made this recipe &#8211; it&#8217;s almost 11pm but I couldn&#8217;t resist trying them. They are absolutely fabulous: crispy on the edges but chewy and soft on the inside. Initially I thought I undercooked them (baked them 11 min) but when they cooled they were perfect!! Thanks for another fabulous recipe!</p>

				<p>I just made these as well, have to agree they are exceptional and my new go-to PB cookie recipe!  I was almost swayed by the many flourless PB cookie recipes claiming lusciousness out there, but these, with some white whole wheat subbed in, dark muscovado sugar and no peanut butter chips, were just&#8230;perfect, with or w/o chocolate bits.  Thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>Wonderful cookies but I used Reeses Pieces instead of the peanut butter chips.  These cookies are soooo good and they are also colorful and fun.  Kids like to choose which cookie they will grab based upon the color of the Reeses Piece I place on the center of each cookie before baking.</p>

				<p>These cookies are fantastic!  I&#8217;ve made them exactly as written, which is incredible&#8211;perfect amount of peanut butter, sugar, and chocolate.  This time I added a box of instant vanilla pudding mix and the results were great&#8211;perfect cakey and chewiness that lasts for a few days.  These cookies are wonderful.  THANKS!</p>

				<p>For the peanut-allergic like me (hugely allergic, bad scene), these are AWESOME with almond butter &#8230; obviously skip the peanut chips too. I&#8217;ve tried them this way and it works beautifully and ooooohhhh sooooooo goooood! Give it a shot &#8211; or try hazelnut butter or whatever you can eat. Yum yum!!!!

				<p>Sent these in a care package to my midshipman at the Naval Academy.  My boy is a traditionalist -&#8221; why make a cookie if it is not a chocolate chip cookie?&#8221;, but once he got over that, he loved them.  So did his roommate who sent me a thank you that very day!  I rolled mine in cane sugar for a little extra crunch on the outside.  Very yummy!</p>

				<p>These are the best PB cookies I&#8217;ve had. They&#8217;re so good that I adapted them into breakfast cookies by cutting some sugar and butter and adding whole wheat. Even then, the cookies are awesome. (And don&#8217;t worry, we still eat them in their virginal, non-healthy form as well.)</p>

				<p>I turned these into crunchy peanut butter hazelnut cookies by using chunky natural peanut butter, increasing the butter to 3/4 cups, and adding about 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts I pulsed in my food processor. I also added a healthy pinch of sea salt. They were perfectly crisp along the edges and soft in the middle the first day and they are still soft and delicious on the 3rd. This is my new favorite cookie.</p>

				<p>I made these the other night following the recipe exactly.  My dough turned out dry and crumbly&#8230; not at all good for scooping and dropping.  I ended up patting it into a 9&#215;13 baking sheet and making bars, which tasted delicious mind you, but the bars were also crumbly.  Do you think it was the peanut butter I used, or possibly an issue with humidity (or lack there of)?</p>

				<p>I followed the recipe exactly, except the chocolate &amp; pb chips. Didn&#8217;t have any on hand, so I tried cutting up a bar of dark chocolate and sticking chucks on top of the cookies. I made some plain, some with sugar and some with chocolate. Although the chocolate was delicious and sugar crunchy, I think I prefer them just plain. They&#8217;re  perfect like that!<br />
I read some comments that the dough might separate if you use natural pb. I used Adam&#8217;s All-Natural crunchy PB and the dough turned out fine. I made 2 trays of big cookies (actually I ended up with 23 cookies).<br />
Next time I think I&#8217;ll cut down on the sugar a bit, but otherwise, I will never buy store made pb cookies again.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a long time reader of your wonderful blog. This recipe is great. Only my husband (from Maine) complained that the cookies I made weren&#8217;t chewy. I didn&#8217;t cook them for any longer than 10 minutes and although they taste good, they don&#8217;t look the same as yours, they look crisper. Anyway, can you offer any advice on how to enure that they be chewy and not crisp? Would cooking them at a lower temperature for longer perhaps do the trick?</p>

				<p>They&#8217;re not the chewiest cookie, I suspect because of the high fat content. When I make them, they&#8217;re a little dry and slightly crunchy on the outside and moist and awesome on the inside. Eggs often add a chewiness to brownies, I wonder if you could experiment with an extra yolk or half a beaten egg&#8230;</p>

				<p>I came to your blog looking for a PB cookie recipe after the one in my Martha Stewart cookie book failed.<br />
These are SO good. Perfect texture, perfect taste. I did teeny cookies too and used mini-chocolate chips because I am not a fan of lots of chocolate. It was a great mix. Thanks!</p>

				<p>These cookies spread much more for me than that (though I did swap out some of the peanut butter for butter because I didn&#8217;t have enough), but they were still crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. Great recipe :)</p>

				<p>Wow I was tantalized by these pics and vowed to make these last night.<br />
Peanut butter-chocolate? Yes please!<br />
While they tasted wonderful and were crunchy and moist, mine spread out way more and were thin (like other commenters noted).  Any clue how to have them look like yours-thick instead of thinned out? Maybe swapping out the baking powder and/or adding another cup of flour? Since I&#8217;m almost out of peanut butter, I thought I&#8217;d ask before experimenting with my last bit. I&#8217;m rubbish with baking chemistry.<br />

				<p>Made these cookies last night! They turned out AMAZING! Tweaked it just a bit by adding a second egg, Made it 2 c flour, used mini choc chips, canni-butter and canni-peanutbutter. 215 compliant! The taste&#8230; phenomenal! Crunchy outside, chewy inside, no running, fluffy and perfect! Plus, I cook on baking stones.  Thank u for inspiring an amazing canni-peanut butter choc chip cookie!!</p>

				<p>These are hands down my new favorite cookie. I&#8217;ve tried a few different batches and thought I&#8217;d weigh in on the natural/not-so-natural peanut butter debate.  I much prefer these with the natural stuff&#8230;to me it&#8217;s just the right sweetness with more of the peanut flavor showing through.  I also took your advice and added an extra egg yolk, and the result was cakey perfection!  Thanks for your endless amounts of inspiration.</p>

				<p>Any suggestions on how to make these in larger form?  I am making cookie packages to sell for a charity and the other cookies in the package are larger &#8211; about 3.5 inches in diameter.  I imagine originally these are smaller, as the scoops are teaspoonfuls&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I just had one of those Homer Simpson, &#8216;Doh!&#8217; moments making these cookies, because when I got to the very end, and the dough split into a greasy mess, I remembered that I had tried this recipe about a year ago, with exactly the same result.  Must be the Costa Rican butter, it&#8217;s much wetter than North American butter.  The baked result looks okay, though.  I&#8217;m waiting for them to cool to try one!<br />
By the way, Deb, to give credit where credit&#8217;s due, I have your smashed baby potatoes with Romesco sauce on my menu, and people LOVE them.  I call them &#8216;Papitas Bravas&#8217;, and I tell anyone who compliments me on them that I got the recipe from your blog :)</p>

				<p>I add my voice to the adoring hordes: GREAT COOKIES! I made mine with dark brown sugar instead of light, half smooth (Jif Natural) and half chunky (Peter Pan Honey Roast) peanut butter, half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chips (cut into smaller pieces), and chopped peanuts in place of of PB chips. I did not chill the dough for the first test batch, and at ten minutes, they were a pale golden color and had not spread unduly.  DELISH!</p>

				<p>This recipe is phenomenal. I came across it a few months ago and it popped into my head again recently when I was crawling the net looking for a good Reeses cookie recipe. Instead of peanut butter chips, I substituted coarsely chopped Reeses and threw in a few Reeses m&amp;ms.</p>
<p>My boyfriend and company have dubbed them the &#8220;Crack Cookie&#8221;. Everything about them is perfect- their texture is absolute bliss. Thank you so much for sharing them with us!</p>

				<p>These are fantastic! I did modify a bit to hanker my craving for a peanut butter and honey sandwich! So in place of sugar I used 3/4 cup of honey and had to add a bit more flour (as the honey makes it too wet) and omitted the chocolate chips. Awesome recipe :)</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t roll the cookies in sugar, too sugary for me, and I never seem to have peanut butter chips on hand so I tend to use a full cup of chocolate chips but the base recipe is absolutely the best chocolate chip peanut butter cookies I&#8217;ve ever made, and I&#8217;ve made a lot of different versions over the years. They bake up like the pictures and have a good peanut butter flavor. Thank you for sharing the recipe, I&#8217;ll be using it again and again!</p>

				<p>I made these cookies today.  My 8 &amp; 9 year old boys loved them along with my hubby.  My boys are extremely difficult to feed. When they are willing to try something AND give it a thumbs-up, along with sounds that assure you they like it, that is a Hallmark moment at our house.   Thanks for a great recipe.</p>
<p>My question is; Is it possible to substitute the sugar in these cookies with Agave?  I am trying to use more low glycemic items.  Would love some input on this issue.  Thanks</p>

				<p>Just pulled these out of the oven. I used your base recipe and made them 3 different ways. I did add a little extra flour to make them more chewy and I used a honey roast peanut butter. I made 1/3 of them plain and didn&#8217;t roll in the sugar. Then I only added chocolate chips to 1/3 of the others&#8230;then the piece de resistance! The remaining 1/3 of the dough I added the chocolate chips, chopped up some thin pretzel sticks, and caramel squares and mixed them in the dough! Ohhhhh EMMMM Goooossssssh!  Best.cookie.ever!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m late on the draw but just made this cookies with my 4 year old son.  They are wicked.  As a previous reader mentioned we substituted chopped reese&#8217;s pieces instead of peanut butter chips.  Fortunately (unfortunately?) with all the peanut allergies out there we had to devour all of these at home.  We didn&#8217;t share a one.  THANKS!</p>

				<p>so i was just over here reading what the comments had to say about the milk (a little low here and trying to make sure everyone has enough for their cereal) and was totally amused that you typed &#8216;i never have milk around&#8217; and wondered if that was still true.</p>

				<p>I made these the other day.  I was craving pb cookies and you are my go-to girl for classic recipes.  I had these tiny little minature pb cups from Trader Joes in the fridge so I decided to do a bit of a variation.  Instaed of the chocolate and pb chips I used these AND instead of mixing them in, I put 2 in the center of each cookie.  It resulted in a ooey gooey surprise in the middle that prompted one neighborhood kid to exclaim, &#8220;These are the best cookies ever!&#8221;  I have to say I kind of agree.</p>

				<p>i try not to overbake my cookies as i prefer them soft and cakey/chewy- like and they do turn out soft but i notice that the middle is slightly damp-looking and a different colour, and probably not cooked through.<br />
With choc chips in the cookie, its hardly noticeable when you take a bite though.<br />
I use an ice-cream scoop to scoop the dough and when i tried baking them longer they start to burn.<br />
so i just make them smaller and flatten the dough before baking.</p>
<p>By the way. this  is not this pb recipe, its just a problem i have in the kitchen.<br />
Thoughts?</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, </p>
<p>I am such a big fan of your blog, your pictures and your stories, terrific. You have a follower in India. I tried these cookies, but felt there were too cakey. Meaning, I need to be extremely careful handling them or they would break. Is that how they are supposed to be? Pls reply.</p>

				<p>So amazing! I baked half of the cookies for 11 minutes and half for 12 and for some reason that extra minute made a huge difference with the chewiness. I would go for 11 (or 10!) next time. Thanks for another winning recipe!</p>

				<p>Yum! In looking for a new peanut butter cookie recipe, I tried this one. It is wonderful &#8212; thank you! In addition, inspired by the great cookies of Crazy Susan&#8217;s Cookies, Ocean City, N.J., I added a peanut butter glaze and then a chocolate glaze on one end of the cookies.</p>

				<p>Just made a second batch Deb and they are just too soft. I am in love with the taste, so badly want to get the firmness in this cookie. If I drop one cookie in a ziplock, it will crumble, it is that soft! Can you suggest something I can do to get this right please?</p>

				<p>Hi L &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t follow your question. You said it wasn&#8217;t about this recipe but cookies in general? That they&#8217;re damp? It would sound like they need more baking time, but it&#8217;s very hard for me to say unless it&#8217;s a recipe I&#8217;ve made and gone into detail with here. Feel free to clarify if I missed what you were asking. I&#8217;d like to help if I can.</p>

				<p>Hi deb -<br />
Thanks for replying.Anyway, just to clarify &#8211; my recipe is basically about chewy cookies in general. The recipe I made was actually Alton Brown&#8217;s The chewy cookie which was adapted from the Nestle tollhouse recipe.<br />
I use a pretty medium-sized ice-cream scoop to scoop the dough but when i broke them in half, i could see some dampness.<br />
The thing is &#8211; I&#8217;ve already baked them a few more minutes then the time stated in the recipe. and when i try to bake it longer, it starts to burn slightly.</p>

				<p>I made a variation on these last night. I was running out of granulated sugar, and  wanted a chewier cookie, so I used dark brown sugar instead. So, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 3/4 cup dark brown sugar. I skipped the peanut butter chips and used all chocolate. Also added 1/4 cup almond butter, for no particular reason other than I had it on hand.</p>
<p>LOVED THEM. </p>
<p>Only thing I wouldn&#8217;t do again is the powdered sugar. They were fine to eat at home because I knew they were fresh, but they almost looked moldy, so I wouldn&#8217;t share them out of the house. Granulated is the way to go.</p>

				<p>10-12 minutes?  Are you kidding?  I knew these were too greasy after I got them all stirred up, but I had faith in the recipe and baked them for 11 minutes.  NOT done, not even close.  I let them cool, but they were still underdone and even after cooling completely, would bend and half the cookie would drop off when I picked it up.  So, I put them each cookie sheet back in the oven for 5 more minutes.  Not enough.  Then 10 more, not enough.  Finally 20 more minutes did it, but the cookies are darker and greasier in the middle and still bendy.  It is impossible to burn these cookies because there&#8217;s so much grease.  Too much butter or too much peanut butter or both.  If I had it to do over again, I would add in more flour.  But then again, I&#8217;ll probably just look for another recipe that isn&#8217;t as greasy and has a more realistic bake time.</p>

If we all ate more peanut butter cookies then there wouldn&#8217;t be world famine or pestilence or even war.  The answer to all of our problems are found deep within a creamy goody good freshly baked warm peanut butter cookie.  Amen.</p>

				<p>I love these cookies! I&#8217;ve made them several times. In anticipation of massive baking for a Christmas party, I rolled the dough into a log (and refrigerated) and sliced them the day of baking. They are a terrific cookie for slice and bake! I did leave out the peanut butter and chocolate chips but everything else was the same. So good &amp; so easy to make. Thanks for the delicious recipe!</p>

				<p>I have made these at least 4 times in the last 3 weeks.  They are amazing!  Also, the 3rd time I made them, I ran out of white flour halfway through and ended up with half white/half whole wheat.  They were amazing &#8211; maybe leaning a little towards the wholesome end of things.  I also used natural peanut butter in all of my batches (because I am ridiculously obsessed with the grind-your-own-pb machine at my grocery store), and they all came out great.  I think it tones down the sweetness quite a bit, which I like.  Deb, your site is my go-to site for cooking and baking.  &#8220;oh, I have a lot of mushrooms in the fridge.  What does SmittenKitchen do with mushrooms?  That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re having for dinner!&#8221;</p>

				<p>I just made these for the first time to send to my mom for her birthday, and they are delicious as everyone above says. I did have a problem with too many chocolate chips though (I didn&#8217;t know that was even POSSIBLE!)- they were preventing the dough from clumping together until I picked out about 1/3 cup of chips. Not a big deal, just a little tedious. Thanks anyway for another home run!</p>

				<p>Hey Smitten, had to read a lot of the comments for this ever popular cookie. I followed the link here from a current post, was in the mood for pb cookies and I am sure your recipe is the one. You&#8217;ve never steered me wrong yet. Can&#8217;t wait to make these for New Year&#8217;s, what a great way to start 2012. And it was so entertaining to read how joyful everyone was with their cookie success. You must get a lot of gratification from reading all the positive feedback.</p>

				<p>In my exceptionally warm (83 degree) and humid kitchen, the room temperature dough looked quite greasy and kind of gross. It oozed little drips of oil while I was scooping/shaping it. But the cookies came out just fine.</p>
<p>I halved the recipe, used smooth Jif peanut butter, accidentally used about 1.5 times as much egg as the recipe indicates (i.e. 3/4 of a beaten egg for my 1/2 batch), made half without any kind of chips, half with just chocolate. My cookies are tiny, chewy in the middle, and completely delicious!</p>

				<p>Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe! My son can&#8217;t eat peanut butter yet due to a sensitivity (a great sadness, since I LOVE it), so I thought I&#8217;d try soynut butter cookies. It worked very well with this recipe! The only changes I made were the soynut butter, using Whole Wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose, and using 1 c. choc chips instead of a mix of chocolate and pb chips. Oh, and I was out of milk so I used a T. of homemade yogurt. The cookies turned out just as you said, and they are amazingly good considering they&#8217;re not peanut butter. Of course, I have no doubt the pb would be even better. :) Thanks again!</p>

				<p>Tried them yesterday yum! Except I&#8217;de say that the extra dipping of sugar was a bit much for my teeth but otherwise fantastic :)</p>

				<p>I generally find peanut butter cookies too dry and sandy. These were chewy and decadent. Love them.</p>

				<p>These look wonderful &#8212; peanut butter cookies are my favorite.  But I like straight PB, and I&#8217;d rather leave the chocolate out.  If I wanted to adapt the recipe, would you suggest that I just omit the chocolate, or should I also up the PB chips to a whole cup?</p>

				<p>Made these with a fresh chocolate pb.  Delicious.  And a huge hit with the kiddos.  I&#8217;m actually making them again &#8211; the 2nd time in a week.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these twice now. The first time I made a double batch for my brother to take to his roommates, which gave me the impression that it made a ton of cookies, which I found out this time is not the case. They are perfect little cookies, peanut buttery, chocolatey and sooooo easy to just mix together. Mmmm, I love them.</p>

				<p>I made a double batch today.  I had lots of peanut butter jars with bits in them so potentially I didn&#8217;t get exactly the right amount.  They took 9 minutes to cook.  YUM!</p>
