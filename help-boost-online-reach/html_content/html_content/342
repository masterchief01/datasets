With the ever-growing selection of hair products that line the shelves of stores and salons, our hair increasingly pays the price. In addition to the chemical warfare that we accidentally launch on our heads, we also use high-heat hair tools that wreak havoc on our tresses. As if we are not abusing our hair enough, we also fail our hair with poor diets and unhealthy lifestyles. <span id="more-44"></span></p>
<p>Despite the fact that we are usually the sole culprit behind our hair problems, we are also the only possible savior. This means that it is not too late to discover how to get healthy hair. Regardless of the current level of damage, the problem can be turned around.</p>
<p><em>How to get healthy hair</em> is best achieved by simplifying your haircare. Almost everybody can remember the healthy hair they had when they were younger. Then we get older and fall prey to the so-called beautifying products and hair tools that ultimately result in the exact opposite. In an attempt to have gorgeous hair, we strip it of its natural beauty. Unfortunately, there is nothing in a can, tube or jar that will get it back. However, going back to the basics is a great way to earn back the beautiful hair we once had. Below is a list of ten helpful tips on how to get healthy hair.</p>
<h2>How to Get Healthy Hair – Ten Useful Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let your hair air-dry.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.foodforhealthyhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/how-to-get-healthy-hair-0.jpg" ><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47" style="margin: 8px;" title="how to get healthy hair" src="http://www.foodforhealthyhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/how-to-get-healthy-hair-0-225x300.jpg" alt="how to get healthy hair" width="173" height="230" /></a>When our hair is wet it is the most vulnerable to damage. However, the blow-dryer is about the least friendly hair tool you can find. For this reason, allowing your hair to air-dry is the best solution. Rearrange your daily schedule so that you have plenty of time between your shower and walking out the door. Ideally, leaving your hair as the last task is the best option. Try to make sure your hair is mostly dry before you put a brush or comb to it. Forcing a brush through wet hair is a sure-fire way to create copious amounts of split-ends. For those with super-thick hair that holds onto water like a sponge, if you must turn to the blow-dryer, make sure to keep it on the non-damaging cool setting. Unfortunately, discovering how to get healthy hair sometimes means we have to give up our favorite hair products and tools – or at least change the way we use them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Give your go-to hair-do a rest every now and then.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On your mission to discover how to get healthy hair you will likely realize the importance of little details. One of these small details is allowing your hair a little freedom. This means that for those that regularly wear their hair in a ponytail, bun or braid, a great idea is to let your hair down every once in awhile. Constant use of hair-ties, clips and bobby-pins will most definitely cause hair breakage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oily hair is best battled with a gentle shampoo.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How to get healthy hair is best achieved when you realize that you can not always trust the label on your hair product. It is reasonable enough to think that extra-oily locks would benefit from a strong oil-reducing cleanser. However, this is simply not the case. Our body, which includes our hair, requires essential oils. When we strip away these important oils, the reaction we get is an onslaught of even more oil. Our hair will compensate for this loss by pumping out even more oil than before. Instead of focusing on expensive hair products that advertise they are made for oily hair, focus on shampoos that are labeled as gentle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baby your hair, it deserves it!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is not just oily hair that can benefit from a gentle cleansing. Almost every hair type will be extremely relieved by going old-school. Old-school in this case means baby shampoo. You will be hard pressed to find a more gentle shampoo, and your hair will greatly appreciate the switch. How to get healthy hair is most often achieved by sticking with the most basic haircare and products.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control split-ends with regular maintenance.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How to get healthy hair requires regular attention and consistency. An important part to keeping split-ends at bay is to have your ends trimmed regularly. A great hair-trimming schedule to keep is every 6-10 weeks, depending on the condition of your hair and the rate in which it grows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stick to a hair-healthy diet.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If anything scares people away it is the word &#8216;diet.&#8217; However, the good news is that a great majority of <a title="Food for healthy hair" href="http://www.foodforhealthyhair.com" >food for healthy hair</a> is absolutely delicious! Additionally, the nutrient-rich foods that help beautify our hair also work double duty maintaining all-around health and well-being. The nutrients that we put into our bodies are the foundation for almost everything that our body does. Foods that stimulate the best growth, damage repair, strengthen and shine include – salmon, chicken, beans, green veggies, yogurt, low-fat cottage cheese, whole grains, sweet potatoes, apricots, carrots, spinach, low-fat mozzarella cheese, cantaloupe, oysters, eggs and tons more! A great rule of thumb is that any fruits and vegetables that are orange or green are most likely great for your hair. How to get healthy hair starts with what we put into our bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steer clear of hair damaging products.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lot easier said than done. However, how to get healthy hair requires accountability for what we put on it. Unfortunately the great majority of products on the market are chuck-full of chemicals. Even the ones labeled as &#8216;natural&#8217; often tell a different story once you read the ingredient list. Finding chemical-free hair products is not always an easy task. However, while it might not be easy, it certainly is possible. A great place to find all-natural hair products is at a health-food store. Very often these stores also stock natural beauty products. Discovering how to get healthy hair usually means rethinking the ingredients that are in the products we use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid high heat to dry or style your hair.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How to get healthy hair usually requires a change in our hair-styling routine. One of the changes that will show the most results in the least time is nixing the heated hair tools. Hair straighteners, dryers and curling irons are the kiss of death to healthy hair. Although you may be tempted to use these favored hair styling tools, it is important to understand that they cause the most severe damage. Hair straighteners are extremely popular, however they cause massive amounts of split ends due to excessive drying and breakage. Additionally, these tools will rapidly deplete the natural shine of healthy hair.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long, unhealthy hair must be cut.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are reading this with three feet of hair hanging behind you, you probably don&#8217;t want to hear it. The bottom line is that long hair is simply a comfort zone for a lot of people. However, learning how to get healthy hair sometimes forces us out of our comfort zone. Long hair requires special attention, extra maintenance and a lot more patience. This does not mean it is not worth it. What it means is that in order to maintain long, healthy hair you must start out with it. The truth of the matter is that regardless of what you do, damaged hair technically can not be repaired. It can in the long run, but essentially you must clip the damaged hair in order to grow new healthy hair. How to get healthy hair usually means you need to do something different. As much as you may not want to, biting the bullet and trimming the damaged hair will eventually lead to much healthier and shinier tresses. Another thing worth considering is that the cut will boost the growth – which means your treasured long hair will return.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your hair&#8217;s health in mind when choosing your haircut.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are on a mission to figure out how to get healthy hair – which you must be if you&#8217;re reading this! &#8211; then keep that mission in mind when choosing your haircut and style. This is extremely important. A trendy haircut that requires ridiculous amounts of product to stay put is not a wise decision. Ask your hairdresser for suggestions on great hairstyles that require minimal product and heated hair tools. Additionally, tell your hairstylist about your desire to discover how to get health hair. You may benefit from the suggestions you get from a professional.</p>
<h3>How to Get Healthy Hair – The Bottom Line</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.foodforhealthyhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/how-to-get-healthy-hair.jpg" ><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48" style="margin: 8px;" title="how to get healthy hair" src="http://www.foodforhealthyhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/how-to-get-healthy-hair-256x300.jpg" alt="how to get healthy hair" width="200" height="234" /></a>The ten above-mentioned tips are all great ways to start healing your damaged hair. However, the truth is there simply is no miracle cure. In order to restore the healthful condition of your hair you must realize the importance of treating it right. This means that you must be conscious of your hair even when you are not in front of the mirror. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The real secret behind how to get healthy hair is that there isn&#8217;t one</span>. There is no quick-fix for this problem as it can only be repaired over time.</p>
<p>Once you understand that how to get healthy hair is a process, you will be on well your way to success. It takes a series of changes as well as consistency to do the job. The great news is that without a doubt, your accidentally-abused hair will certainly respond to these changes. Another great thing to consider is that laying low on the harsh products and hair styling is not only rewarding to your hair, but also your pocket and time. You will spend less money and shave time off of your daily routine with basic haircare.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you treat your hair right, it will return the favor. How to get healthy hair requires a nutrient rich diet, healthful lifestyle decisions, and letting go of harsh, chemical-ridden hair products.</p>

		<p>Drinking lots of water and have a healthy diet, gives me very healthy hair.

		<p>I really appreciate this well-written article due to the fact that is so true!  I suffer from both oily and dry hair. The solution?  A moisturizing shampoo and conditioner!  Some would say this only treats the dryness factor, but it really helps with both oiliness and dryness!  using a clarifying shampoo to rid your hair of oil will only make it produce even more oil to repair itself.  The gentle, natural, moisturizing shampoo/conditioners are the way to go! Always!  Also, you want to stick to a chemical-free and Sulfate-Free shampoo!!!!!  Sulfates will dry hair and its really just so damaging!</p>

		<p>I agree you should totally baby your hair. also try not to take bath/showers everyday, try washing your hair every other day. Using Pantene or treseme (shampoo+conditioner) is great and you should probably trim your hair every 2 months!!!! &lt;3</p>

		<p>Hello</p>
<p>I badly need some advice. I am 23 yrs old and I am on my last year at the university. I am also working on a full- time basis as a programmer. I love my job and my studies. However, I get tired very often and this leads to stress. I have even suffered from Alopecia last year. It has now been cured. </p>
<p>The problem is that I have recently noticed that I am suffering from hair loss. I know it is because of stress but I can&#8217;t help it. I&#8217;m on my last semester at the university and I just hope that my load of work will diminish after that. I just want to know that if I start living a healthy life style, will I be able to grow my hair healthily? I have a straigt thin hair line and it is lustrous, though.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
