<p>Continuing your education not only benefits you, but it benefits the children in your care and the families for whom you work. If you are serious about being a career nanny, consider continuing your education. Like with any career, the more specialized education you have, the greater your earning potential and marketability will be. When competing for jobs, setting yourself a part as an educated professional could make the difference between landing the job and the job going to someone else.</p>
