<div id="entrybody">
<p>It has long been my personal belief that the egg salad sandwich is a sandwich too ugly to look at, let alone eat.  I'm talking about those structure-less mayo bombs served on soggy white bread. An egg salad sandwich fitting this description shows up at my house roughly once a week wrapped in tight-fitting plastic - pretty much whenever Wayne hits up the neighborhood sandwich shop. I always look at him incredulously and ask...really? You <i>really</i> want to eat that? I just don't get it. Generally speaking he doesn't even like eggs very much. Whoever cast the egg salad sandwich spell on him did a fine job.</p>

<p>It wasn't until last week when we went to the <a href="http://www.thinker.org/deyoung/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?exhibitionkey=657" target="new">Vivienne Westwood exhibit</a> at the de Young museum that I was forced to rethink my position. At the café my friend <a href="http://www.quyenknits.com/" target="new">Quyen</a> submitted her sandwich order (one egg salad please)....I looked at her and shook my head. You too? This in turn opened up a lengthy lunchtime conversation on the merit of egg salad. Egg Salad Sandwich Lovers:2, Haters: 1.</p>

<p>My case wasn't helped by what was about to come out of the café kitchen. When her sandwich appeared before us the clouds parted, angels sang, and a golden beam of sunlight was cast onto her plate. It was an egg salad sandwich of a totally different breed. You could see vibrant yellow yolks, flecks of herbs, and capers. Mayo? Little if any. And the best part? Not a soggy piece of bread in sight. </p>

<p>And this is how inspiration strikes. I saw Quyen's tasty looking egg salad sandwich and it showed me that  a sandwich made of hard-boiled eggs can be appetizing to both the eye and the taste buds. I thought about it for a few days and came up with a game plan for my own that went something like this. For the bread - whole grain bread toasted and sliced on the thin side. Toasting will help deter the sog-factor. Some crunchy add-ins were going to be critical to counter the mush factor of the eggs. My choice? Chopped celery. Eggs pair beautifully with herbs - at the market I was on the lookout for fresh dill, but came across chives instead. Perfect. I knew I was after a drier egg salad mixture and would use a minimal amount of mayo - just enough to bind the egg mixture together. Achieving bright yellow yolks would be of the utmost importance. A friend of my sister's recommended chopped bacon as an addition. I countered with fried shallots, but didn't end up using them at the last minute - the flavor was overpowering the eggs and chives. If you wanted to go that route, a remix of this sandwich where you broil some thinly sliced gruyere cheese onto your toast, top with the egg salad mixture, sprinkle with the fried shallots, and serve open-faced would likely be delicious.</p>

<p>It also dawned on me that this is prime egg salad sandwich season! Put all those leftover hard-boiled eggs from Easter to good use (I should note that we always had leftover hardboiled eggs that we didn't use in the hunt).</p>

<p>Before I sign off, I'd like to thank everyone for the overwhelmingly enthusiastic response to the <a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001574.html">Unwilling Cook's</a> letter earlier this week. 180+ fantastic, thoughtful responses - and they are STILL coming in! It makes me very proud to have such an amazing community of readers, and I promise to keep you posted on his progress.</p>

<h1>Egg Salad Sandwich (the only one I'll eat)</h1>

<p><em>I've realized that 90% of the challenge here is properly boiling the egg. You need to boil it so the center sets yet stays moist. You also need to avoid the green/grey ring thing that surrounds the yolk in many hard boiled eggs. I use the same technique here that I learned camping with a hardcore egg enthusiast. It has worked for me flawlessly ever since. The key is to avoid over cooking, and to dunk the eggs in a bowl of icy water to stop the cooking after you remove them from the hot water. I always use good quality eggs - but something to keep in mind, the fresher they are, the harder they are to peel after boiling.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>6 large eggs<br />
1-2 tablespoons mayonnaise (or Greek yogurt)<br />
Salt and pepper<br />
A tiny squeeze of lemon juice<br />
2 stalks celery, washed and chopped<br />
1/2 bunch chives, chopped<br />
2 small handfuls of lettuce<br />
8 slices of whole grain bread, toasted</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Place the eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by a 1/2-inch or so. Bring to a gentle boil. Now turn off the heat, cover, and let sit for exactly seven minutes. Have a big bowl of ice water ready and when the eggs are done cooking place them in the ice bath for three minutes or so - long enough to stop the cooking. Crack and peel each egg, place in a medium mixing bowl. Add the mayonnaise, a couple generous pinches of salt and pepper, now mash with a fork. Don't overdo it, you want the egg mixture to have some texture. If you need to add a bit more mayo to moisten up the mixture a bit, go for it a bit at a time.</p>

<p>Stir in the celery and chives. Taste, and adjust the seasoning - adding more salt and pepper if needed.</p>

<p>To assemble each egg salad sandwich: place a bit of lettuce on a piece of toast, top with the egg salad mixture, and finish by creating a sandwich with a second piece of toast.</p>

<p><em>Make 4 sandwiches.</em></p>

The smell of them cooking was enough to make me ill when I was younger. </p>

<p>Since then, I've had an aversion to it but I decided awhile back to try and make hard boiled eggs because i loved deviled eggs. I have seen so many recipes calling for different amounts of time to leave them in the pot with the water - from your amount to 16 minutes. I find if I leave them covered for 12 minutes they seem perfect to me. I don't like them too soft. I am not a fan of the overly soft yolk. Are you sure that the yolks will cook enough in this amount of time? Seems too little IMHO.</p>

<p>Just curious how firm the yolks get. I have undercooked them in the past and gotten yolks that ran too much. </p></div></div>

In Australia, we have a tradition of the curried egg sandwich with the chiffonade of lettuce.  As scorned as iceberg is, it adds that counterpoint of crunch to the egg.

The fact that there are already 36 comments on something as seemingly mundane as an egg salad sandwich is a testament to your genius!  And to the rippling effects on the community of readers who take the time to post comments & ideas.  I love the suggestion of using softened butter mashed with the yolks.  Now I'm thinking about trying arugalo in place of lettuce - or maybe making a homemade basil mayo to make it really special?  There are probably so many possible variations you'd never have to eat the same sandwich twice, unless you wanted to!  Another great post, thanks Heidi!</p></div></div>

I'll have to try it the next time I'm at the deYoung. BTW, how did you like the Vivenne Westwood exhibit? Also, have you tried making the egg salad mix with a little mustard? That's how we used to make it growing up. It's always a 2 to 1 ratio of mustard to mayo. (And that's mostly to give the mustard a little bit of creamy texture.) And if you like sweet pickle relish or bell peppers, that's good too. Now I'll have to bookmark your site .. I just found it via Gmail's little popups. Looks interesting!</p></div></div>

All four of us hungry like bears and not a one of wanting to hault our task for fear of getting behind while someone fried an egg... </p>

<p>I took it upon myself to make egg salad. We had all the components on hand - shredded eggs, fresh herbs, good bread, HOUSE MADE TARRAGON AOLI and crispy bacon bits. I made three mounding sandwiches and fed them to my team mates, they were met with oohs and ahhs. </p>

<p>Usually I'm a big fan of your blog, and this recipe is no exception, but I have to disagree most vehemently with your suggestion to use cooked eggs that have been sitting out, unrefridgerated, often in the sun and/or dirt, for hours, possibly days.  Easter eggs should be admired, enjoyed, and ultimately thrown out - they are a novelty/luxury decoration, and those who can afford to make them in the first place can afford to chuck them and boil up some fresh-cooked eggs if they'd like a sandwich.</p>

<p>Thanks, otherwise, though - the recipe (and your others as well) looks great!  I always hated mayo (homemade being an entirely different animal, and therefore an exception)... we don't often make egg salad at my house, but started a while back putting small-grained cottage cheese in tuna salad instead of mayo; add some crushed pineapple and serve with chips (on or off bread) for my favourite childhood lunch.  I imagine this binder could be applied to eggs, too, although I'm not sure how the finished product would taste (I probably wouldn't add pineapple to this one!) - I'll have to go experiment!</p></div></div>

To minimize the amount of mayo in the salad, I separate the boiled eggs, mashing the yolks first and adding a wee bit of mayo, just to make them creamy, and then coarsely mashing in the whites. The mayo gets evenly distributed and you avoid the mayo overload that is the death of a good egg salad. Re: spices and add-ins, I defer to the other egg salad experts in the field. Enjoy the eggs!</p></div></div>

Cold, warm, soggy, over-mayoed, under-mayoed, with leftover Easter eggs, eggs that have been sitting in the fridge for six months, fresh eggs, overboiled eggs (but NEVER underdone eggs), mustard, celery or celery seed, mayo, cheese or no cheese, tunafish added, crispy iceberg lettuce with no nutritional value whatsoever, bacon crumbles or sliced green olives, scallions, chives... Egg salad is just a high-protein base for hundreds of combinations, and it wears well on day-old Wonderbread, or Portugese rolls or French loves with the middles hollowed out to make room for all of the veggies you add.  I just made a HUGE tray of deviled eggs using all the leftover Easter eggs (who on *earth* THROWS AWAY dozens of colored eggs?... actually, who on earth lets them sit in the sun for hours? We hide ours indoors, right before the kids get up, and they find them within thirty minutes -- plenty of time to go back in the fridge to be used for food.)</p>

<p>Seriously, though, egg salad is a lovely, /lovely/ thing, and it's great that you've found a way to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Try salted sunflower seeds -- it's a surprisingly good surprise in egg salad.</p>

<p>My favorite 'egg salad' recipe started out as a joke, like 'who can come up with the grossest food combination'?</p>

<p>Pumpernickel bread, mushed hardboiled eggs, honey mustard.... and peanut butter. I know it sounds horrifying, but I promise, it's *actually* *delicious*.</p></div></div>

You are only the third person I've ever known about who didn't like egg salad sandwiches.  I usually butter each piece of bread and find that really helps the "sog" factor.  Plus it's really delicious.  I also read a newsletter once that suggested chopped cucumber (without any seeds) tossed with the eggs.  I personally use celery and a small amount of diced sweet onion.  Also, I think if you happen to make deviled eggs (I don't), you could adapt whatever you put in the deviled eggs to work with eggs for salad (perhaps mustard, a little vinegar).  The trick is to use a sparse amount of dressing.  I particularly like to make egg salad tea sandwiches.  For those I use thinly sliced whole wheat bread, butter the bread, and use a pretty lettuce leaf with a small amount of egg salad so the sandwiches are thin.  But tea sandwiches are another topic altogether.....<br />

As for mayo, I have recently found that I am in love with the Hellman's brand AKA Best Foods on the West Coast. I found it to be more fluffy, tasty, and light. The flavor is amazing! No more Kraft for me! Too vinegary. I like chives, but they are hard to find here, so I will use green onions or leeks, they are the same only bigger. Thanks for the ideas!</p></div></div>

I think you have to use your own judgement regarding the eggs and if they are good.  Typically on Easter Sunday, my parents would take our dyed eggs that were in the refrigerator and get up early in the morning to hide them around the house and yard.  Once they were all hidden, we would be called to go find them.  How long were the eggs out?  Maybe an hour or two, and early in the morning when the temperatures are still quite cool.  The eggs are cooked, the shell offers a protective barrier to the elements.  If the egg shell is cracked, throw the egg out.  But otherwise, the egg is fine. I think it would be a complete waste of perfectly good food to throw these eggs out.   </p></div></div>

My family begs for egg salad sandwiches, but I rarely have the time.  Mine is fairly simple.  I use Hain mayo made with safflower because I do not use soy products.  I just keep adding mayo until I have that stiffness when mixing.  Too much ruins it.  Oh, I use the old time egg slicer - I slice it long ways and take it out and cut it the other way - makes a nice, neat appearance to the mixture.  I add a very small amount of organic brown mustard - just about the size of a quarter for 10 eggs.  If it is barely tasted, that was my goal.  A small amount of celery seeds and now for the best items to complement the mix.  We have what is called Vegen bread here in one of our healthfood stores.  It is whole wheat and covered with pumpkin seeds - ymm - very nutty and good.  No sog because the bread is tight textured.  I use the butter lettuce or some may refer to it as Boston lettuce.  The absolute ultimate to us is nice, fresh alfalfa sprouts.  It gives it a nice, healthy taste.  I make my tuna much the same way - no celery seeds, but fresh celery, red onion, green pepper, and those matchstick carrots.  Boston lettuce and alfalfa sprouts, of course.  I toast the bread now and again for variety.  Organic eggs make me sick and I do not understand why.  This is a wonderful site - thank you!</p></div></div>

Those of you who like pickles and onions in their egg salad, i just dont get it, it totally overpowers the subtle flavor of the egg.  I have to remind everyone, Heidi inlcuded, that egg salad is about EGG.  That said my personal favorite egg salad sandwich includes a couple of pieces of bacon for just the right amount of salt, smoke, and crunch.  And then a slice of a good tomato on top of that and maybe a little lettuce, its perfect.  </p></div></div>

<p>If egg salad creeps you out [or the eggs themselves] try a flavor packet mix by 'Nasoya' called 'Eggless Salad.'   <br />
A 'NewMenu' food in the all-natural TofuMate line!  It is super good!</p>

<p>You simply crumble a 14-15 oz container of firm tofu with mayo [Vegenaise works better and NO cholesterol!] and a teeny bit of vinegar and let it chill for a while in the fridge [if you can wait].  WOO!  </p>

<p>Pop it on some toast-  Delicious, no cholesterol from  eggs OR the spread, and no cooking [or the smelling of cooking eggs that so many seem to hate] involved!  =)</p>

<p>In fact...  I think I have to go make some now.  :p</p></div></div>

For the mayo I used two egg yolks, 500 mL of olive oil, and two tsp of rice wine vinegar.  After the yolk had accepted all of the oil I added fresh dill, lemon juice, salt & pepper, and a sizable squirt of wasabi paste.  For those of you who like a little crunch I suggest chopped water chestnuts drained and briefly pan fried.  Eat it on bread as dark as pumpernickel or as white as wonder; it’s all about the mayonnaise.</p></div></div>

<p>I adore your site.  The other trick to really yellow yolks is to use eggs from happy chickens that have been eating greens.  We raise our own meat birds (sorry, I know your a veg - I was too until I got a piece of land to raise my own meat) and laying hens.  Our yolks are positively golden in the spring when the hens have lots of greens on which to graze.  As summer heats up and our pasture dries to a golden brown our hens are only given the greens that are leftovers and whatever we dig up from the garden and their yolks pale considerably.  The taste of the spring eggs is incomparable to any I've tasted.  One may purchase pasture raised eggs from Taxiera farms in Bolinas and Marin Sun Farms in Point Reyes Station.  It's worth the drive, believe me....One may also bulk up and buy a few dozen at a time - these eggs are so fresh they keep for nearly a month in the fridge.   Happy eating!  I'm one of those folks that likes chopped egg sandies any way she can get them!</p></div></div>

<p>...lol, just kidding. I actually thought this was really creative and it made me want to try it. I really do love egg salad sandwiches (yes, goopy mayonnaise and all) but I wanted to try a new twist on an old favorite.</p>

<p>Instead of following your recipe, though, I decided to experiment with what I had. So after chopping up some boiled eggs I added dill weed, paprika, all purpose seasoning and an extra pinch of salt...and cinnamon. (!) Yeah, I even surprised myself with that one.</p>

<p>I added about half a table spoon of whipped salad dressing (hate the stuff, but we were out of mayonnaise). I tasted it after it was all mixed and I could still taste the whipped dressing so I added just a touch more cinnamon, put it on some wheat bread, and it was perfect sandwich.</p>

<p>I swear I've never had such a delicious egg salad sandwich in my life.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying something different, because now I know the recipe to the perfect sandwich!</p></div></div>
