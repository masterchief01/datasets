<p>I turned on the news this morning and found out that Spring is about to officially begin!  But rather than jump into the spring recipes, I&#8217;m going to help you savor these last couple days of winter by providing the the ultimate comforting soup recipe: a thick and hearty potato leek soup.<span id="more-766"></span></p>
<p>Over the years, I have made and shared this particular recipe more than any other. So, of course, friends and family have been asking why I&#8217;ve never posted it on Pinch My Salt.  That&#8217;s a very good question. The answer is simple:  this is my mom&#8217;s soup.</p>
<p>What does that mean?  Well, it&#8217;s just hard to write about a recipe that is so intertwined with memories of the person <a href="http://pinchmysalt.com/2007/08/17/find-your-inner-bumblebee/" target="_blank">who meant the most to me</a> and who isn&#8217;t here to make it anymore.  I can make the soup, eat the soup, share the soup, but just haven&#8217;t quite been able to write about it without the waterworks starting up.</p>
<p>But hearty soup season is almost over so I got out the box of tissue, pulled out the 15-year-old recipe card, and I&#8217;m here to share the easy but wonderful potato leek soup recipe that has the power to transport me back to my childhood with just one bite.</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1515.jpg" alt="Potato Leek Soup Crop" /></p>
<p><strong>K&#8217;s Potato Leek Soup</strong></p>
<p>3 tablespoons butter<br />
3 leeks, thinly sliced*<br />
1 medium or large onion, chopped<br />
6 &#8211; 8 russet potatoes, thinly sliced**<br />
3 1/2 cups chicken broth (or enough to barely cover potatoes)<br />
1 cup heavy cream<br />
salt to taste<br />
fresh ground black pepper to taste</p>
<p>1) Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat then add onions and leeks.  Cook, stirring, until onions are limp and just slightly brown.</p>
<p>2)  Add sliced potatoes to saucepan then pour in enough chicken broth to just barely cover the potatoes.  Continue cooking over medium heat until potatoes are tender.  Using a potato masher, mash and stir potatoes until desired consistency is reached.  As you mash the potatoes and the soup thickens, turn down heat and stir frequently with a large spoon to prevent scorching on the bottom.</p>
<p>3) Add one cup of heavy cream (or more if you desire) and salt and black pepper to taste.  Cook 15 minutes more over low heat, stirring frequently, then remove from heat and serve.</p>
<p>Notes: *Make sure to <a href="http://homecooking.about.com/od/howtocookvegetables/a/leekcleaning.htm" target="_blank">clean leeks thoroughly</a> and slice only the white and light green part of the leeks.  **You don&#8217;t need to peel the potatoes as the peels add to the rustic texture of the soup. But make sure to scrub them thoroughly and remove any obvious blemishes before slicing.  Although we always make it with chicken broth, this can easily become a vegetarian soup by simply using vegetable broth instead.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a quick photo tutorial to show you how easy it is to make!</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1488.jpg" alt="Potatoes in Food Processor" /></p>
<p>First of all, I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret. For years I always sliced my potatoes by hand until I realized that my new food processor has a large enough feed tube to fit one or two whole potatoes at a time!  Now I always slice my potatoes in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCuisinart-PowerPrep-14-Cup-Capacity-Processor%2Fdp%2FB00133XGNQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dmiscellaneous%26qid%3D1205955323%26sr%3D8-4&amp;tag=pimysa-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank">Cuisinart food processor</a> using the slicing blade.  If you have one that will work, great!  If not, just slice them by hand using a sharp knife to about 1/4 inch thick.  It really doesn&#8217;t take as long as you think!</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1481.jpg" alt="Browning onions and leeks" /></p>
<p>Start the soup by sauteeing the leeks and onions in butter until they are limp and just starting to brown.</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1491-1.jpg" alt="Add the sliced potatoes" /></p>
<p>Next, add all of the potatoes that you worked so hard to slice (unless you&#8217;re a cheater like me).</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1492.jpg" alt="Adding Chicken Broth" /></p>
<p>After adding potatoes, pour in enough chicken broth to just barely cover them.  The amount you use depends on the size and amount of potatoes you sliced.  Two 14 oz. cans of broth is average but use more if you need it.</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1503-1.jpg" alt="Cover Potatoes with Chicken Broth" /></p>
<p>As you can see the level of liquid is just even with the potatoes.  If I push down on the potatoes with the masher, they will be completely submerged.  This amount of liquid results in a very thick soup.  The soup can always be thinned at the end with some extra broth if desired.</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1505.jpg" alt="Mashing Potatoes" /></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take long for the potatoes to cook and you can probably start mashing within 10 minutes or so.  The amount of mashing you do is entirely up to you.  If you like chunkier soups, leave the potatoes a bit chunky.  If you want a smooth soup, mash for a longer time.  If you prefer a completely smooth soup, peel the potatoes before slicing and puree soup with a hand blender.  I&#8217;ve never done this but I&#8217;m sure it would work.</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1508.jpg" alt="Adding Heavy Cream" /></p>
<p>When the soup has reached your desired consistency, add some heavy cream.  The original recipe says 1 &#8211; 2 cup of cream but I never use more than one cup.  I think you lose a lot of flavor by adding more cream.  But, again, it&#8217;s up to you.  Make sure to season well with salt and pepper after stirring in the cream.</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1513.jpg" alt="Soup is Ready" /></p>
<p>This is what my soup looks like when it&#8217;s ready to eat. As you can see, I like a slightly chunky consistency but no large pieces of potato.</p>
<p><img src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_1519.jpg" alt="Potato Leek Soup" /></p>
<p>Enjoy!

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I made a very similar recipe the other day to eat along with our corned beef (leftover) rueben sandwiches.  No a single serving was left, which made me so sad because I was banking on it as a my lunch the next day.  It&#8217;s so nice when simple ingredients and a simple recipe yield amazing results.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Those look much more like yukon gold potatoes than russets.   Because yukon gold have a more potato-y flavor, they&#8217;d be nicer in the soup than russets, anyway, so I&#8217;m not complaining.  If I were using russets, I&#8217;d certainly want to peel them.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b>Peter:</b> Yes, those were some nice looking leeks!  </p>
<p><b>Kat:</b> What a great idea!  I actually haven&#8217;t made this in a while.  These photos were taken a while back.  We have some leftover corned beef in the fridge because I didn&#8217;t make it til the day after St. Paddy&#8217;s day.  Maybe I should whip up some potato soup to eat with leftovers tonight!  <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><b>Kickpleat:</b> Wow, once a week!  We didn&#8217;t have it quite that often but it brings back memories just the same. <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><b>Joy:</b> Thanks! </p>
<p><b>Michelle:</b> That&#8217;s the great thing about almost all potato soups&#8230;simple to make but very satisfying and delicious!  </p>
<p><b>Johan:</b>  You&#8217;re right, those aren&#8217;t russets in the photos.  These photos were taken while I still lived in Italy and my Italian potatoes were somewhat similar to yukon golds.  But we generally just use russets for this soup, because those were the kind of potatoes we grew up eating.  I happen to like the skins but like I mentioned earlier, it&#8217;s all a matter of taste <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />   Yukon Golds or any other type of potato would certainly be fine for this!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This is one of my favorite soups. I don&#8217;t usually add the cream &#8212; it&#8217;s a luxury item in our house &#8212; but I do puree with an immersion blender.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b>Lydia:</b> It tastes good even without the cream but I always splurge <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />   One of my friends made it with milk instead of cream and I liked it.  And one could always split the difference and use half and half <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This soup definitely reminds me of your Mom. She made it for us every time we visited your family&#8217;s cabin. It certainly brings back very warm and precious memories. I never actually attempted to make it, I have seen several version of it online. I can&#8217;t wait to try it, thanks for sharing the recipe. I remember once your Mom added little ham bits to it, she changed it up which took me by surprise.<br />
Thanks!! <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b>Ruby:</b> I assumed you had the recipe, I think Steph does.  You&#8217;ve really never made it?  As for the ham in the soup&#8230;she never made it like that for me and I&#8217;ve never done it myself although I&#8217;ve been tempted to try it.  What I&#8217;d really like to make is a baked potato soup with bacon, cheese, chives, etc.  I&#8217;m making myself hungry now!</p>

I know it is one of those foods that triggers wonderful memories of K, and at the same time makes you miss her even more!  I have to say I think this is one of the first recipes I ever made!  I love it!  It really does take me back to the good ol&#8217; days.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Thanks so much for sharing this precious recipe of your Mum&#8217;s.  I can see why it such a special recipe.  I&#8217;ve never made it with so little stock before, and mine always seems a little too watery so I think your point about the relatively small amount of stock is spot on.  I will try it your way now!</p>

My husband doesn&#8217;t like leeks (the only thing he just can&#8217;t eat) but I do love them and will make this soup when he is not around:)) You have a beautiful blog, nice writing, nice pictures! I will be back soon!</p>

<p>Beautiful soup! I&#8217;ll have to try the recipe since we have leeks from, you guessed it, the CSA. Leeks always make me think soup and I was looking for a recipe to use them in. I&#8217;ll let you know how it looks.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Watch out for the chicken broth, because prepared broths like Swanson&#8217;s have oxidized, and have an unpleasant metallic flavor that comes through in the soup. The recipe I have is from Shirley King&#8217;s book &#8220;Pampille&#8217;s Table,&#8221; a translation and adaptation of Marthe Daudet&#8217;s 1919 classic &#8220;Les Bons Plats de France.&#8221; This authentic French recipe uses 2 quarts of cold water (also good for veggie soup-eaters), one bunch of leeks, 4 medium potatoes, salt and pepper. You use 4 tablespoons of crème fraîche and two tablespoons of butter to thicken it&#8211;which might be less fat than the cup of whipping cream&#8211;and put a slice of stale baguette in the bottom of the bowl before ladling soup over it. Great for parties!</p>

<p>I like to make soup at least once a week to have with dinner because it&#8217;s filling, SO yummy and so good for you (veggie varieties anyway). Anytime is a good time for soup in my book. I used to make it more when I lived in Portland because it was cold. Now in southern Cali, I really do have to remind myself to make it.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This soup is just one of those things that seems like love in a bowl, so it doesnt surprise me that it is a food that brings back strong memories for you. My husband feels the same way about potato leek soup. For me it was always the memory of my mom getting up early on really cold midwestern winter mornings to make us old fashioned oatmeal with brown sugar and raisins. To this day it brings back memories of childhood in one bite.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This soup looks amazing.<br />
I&#8217;m very impressed with your ability to write about a recipe that means so much to you. I can understand why this would be difficult &#8211; food is so tied to our lives, and our memories, and when you make a favorite dish it can be like bringing the person back, sitting with them while you cook and eat. And to write it down&#8230;. it&#8217;s giving a finite quality to something that feels so infinte. Bravo for that, possibly more than for the recipe. (Although let&#8217;s face this, I&#8217;m probably going to unceremoniously gank this recipe and use it mercilessly). </p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>What a great night for a hearty winter soup. I have no culinary spontaneity or imagination so, when it is my turn to cook, I struggle. Today is a cold winter&#8217;s day down under, I am on holidays and I wanted the smell of great food wafting through the kitchen for when my wife comes home from work. Your recipe did the trick at many levels. Sensational -</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Hi Nicole,<br />
 I was wondering if you could help me? I have leeks but not sure if one of the &#8220;leaves&#8221; is one leek or if the whole &#8220;stalk&#8221; is the leek. Thanks for your help.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b>Marie:</b> The whole stalk is considered to be one leek. But the dark green &#8216;leaves&#8217; at the top generally get cut off and discarded.  For most recipes (including this one), you just use the white and maybe some of the light green part on the bottom.  Hope this helps!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I was looking for a recipe to cook for my wife on Wednesday as she finally got a job and demanded I cook for her one time after 10 years!  And thought, how about a tuna caserole. Something different and something I can&#8217;t goof up. I ate them at friends houses when I was a kid during the 80&#8242;s Thats how i came upon your blog!<br />
Now I also stummbled upon this potato/leek soup which I love but it looks a winner as well. Wish me luck!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>WOW! Mine is simmering as we speak&#8230; I followed this recipe step by step and have never made a better potato leek soup.  IMHO, the flavor is even better than the PL soups by by Jamie Oliver and Emeril!  I admit I had to add BACON (I add bacon to everything but chocolate cake &#8211; LOL).  I added 10 slices of pre-cooked cut bacon during the simmer stage.  Question:  Is there a flavor benefit to slicing the potatoes rather than dicing them, it seemed more mashing was required in the pot?  Thanks to you (and your mom) for a wonderful comfort-food recipe.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I just wanted to let you know that I found this recipe through StumbleUpon a few weeks ago and bookmarked it for when cold weather hit. It&#8217;s not terribly cold here, but I woke up this morning *with* a cold, so I decided it was time to make the soup. I&#8217;m finishing my first bowl now, and it&#8217;s so amazingly good! I feel like someone who loves me made me soup (the point of the entry, I&#8217;m quite sure), and it goes a long way to easing the illness.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for sharing what is clearly a very personal recipe. It will brighten a lot of winter tables, judging by the comments here!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for such a lovely recipe and history.  I think that all food is intimately tied to our memories and our personal stories.  I&#8217;ve been looking for a recipe for potato leek soup (because I have an abundance of both) and I&#8217;ll use this one because of the story you relayed.  It makes it feel more meaningful even to me as a stranger.  Thank you for sharing.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>i recently went to a resteraunt and they had this as the soup of the day, I had never tried it but soon grew to love it after one bowl !!!! I googled the recipie afterward as I wanted to make it myself. I came across this recipie but was a bit hesitant, so many recipies I find dont taste anything like they should. I made this and it tasted exactly the same it is so yummy. I used a food puree though so it was smooth and I thin next time I will use 2 leeks as my little ones said it was a bit stong in flavour. Thankyou for putting up a recipie that actually tastes like it should .  <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This is virtually identical to the recipe that I like to make, but there is one significant difference.  Instead of using butter to cook the leeks and onions, I take 3 strips of bacon, chop them into small pieces, and cook until there is enough fat rendered for cooking the leeks and onions.  The small pieces of bacon, and the taste of bacon fat throughout the soup add a wonderful taste.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>OMG, I&#8217;m now famous for this recipe&#8230;I make it for family, coworkers, friends.  I took some on sick visits to hospitals, they all felt so loved and I know it&#8217;s due to this great recipe. Thanks soooo much for sharing and putting pen to paper. The sliced potatoes are GENIUS!!! I wish I could have thought of it on my own. They break down very well, and depending on my mood of &#8220;to peel or not to peel&#8221;&#8230;.either way works, elegant or rustic.  I sometimes add shallots/bacon/ cheese, whatever I have on hand.  I like the earlier comment to add stale baguette, so will try it next.</p>

<p>1. Absolutely fantastic<br />
2. Great tip using the Cuisinart/food processor to slice potatoes, leeks, onions.<br />
3. I added some chopped bacon to the butter and cooked it about 5 minutes before sauteing the leeks and onions&#8230;IMHO, the bacon is a crucial ingredient.   </p>
<p>This may have been one of the best soups  I have ever made.   Thank You.</p>

<p>What do you usually serve this with, if you don&#8217;t mind me asking? I just served with crispy baked rolls, but I definitely want to work this into Christmas dinner.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b> Mike:</b> Thanks for your comment!  I&#8217;m sure the bacon adds a wonderful flavor to the soup, and I do love other potato soups with bacon.  But I always make this one without anything extra since it&#8217;s my mom&#8217;s soup and I&#8217;ve been eating it this way since I was young!  But I definitely encourage everyone to make this soup their own by making delicious changes like you suggested!</p>
<p><b>MW:</b> We usually eat the soup with nothing more than some homemade bread and maybe a side salad.  So glad to hear that you and your family loved it!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I just made this soup for my sick-with-a-cold roomate and I after searching for some hearty soup recipes. Needless to say it was wonderful, although I felt it needed a little something (just as the people with the bacon tip) and added some dried dill. My roomate said the dill was the key, and I definetly agree.  I served the meal with some warm grainy rolls and butter. A lovely home recipe to keep cozy. Thanks!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I loved the 8&#215;10 glossy photos.  I am going to make this soup for my family.  I may take someones suggestion on the Yukon Gold potatoes.  She said they have more of a potato taste for the soup.  I will use the 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream because we always have that in the refridgerator.  I don&#8217;t believe I have ever had leeks and my daughter will love fresh, hot potato soup.  I liked the story that the family dog didn&#8217;t eat peas. I thought that was a dog after a kids heart.  My dog loves everything, from tomato soup to Jello.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Mmmm, good soup!  Very homely and comforting.  I was looking for a good potato and leek soup recipe, and decided on yours because I loved the way you shared the story about your mom&#8230; very moving, and much more appealing than just a soulless list of ingredients and steps like most recipes!  My attempt came out a bit thinner than I would have liked &#8211; maybe you have smaller measuring cups in the US than we have here in Australia?? &#8211; but it&#8217;ll be well worth another attempt soon!  Thank you for sharing this.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I fell in love with potato leek soup about a month ago, at a pub. I liked it so much, I brought the boyfriend with me to have it, and while he was hesitant to order his own, he managed to eat most of mine.</p>
<p>The story behind this recipe, and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t call for bacon (something I don&#8217;t so much enjoy with anything but scrambled eggs), is the reason I&#8217;m making this soup tomorrow. As a university student, it also seems like a fairly cost effective recipe, for quite a bit of soup. This sounds like the thing for a cold Montreal winter! I&#8217;ll report back, to let you know how it went <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Made this soup yesterday, and as I said I would, I&#8217;m reporting back. The only changes I can think of making is I maybe used 1/2 cup of cream rather than a whole one, and I used yukon gold potatoes (they were on sale, so they win.) The boyfriend loved it too!</p>
<p>Thanks again for such a yummy recipe! I&#8217;ll definitly be making this at least once a winter!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b>KD:</b> Thanks for reporting back! Yes, the cream can definitely be adjusted to suit your own taste. I&#8217;ve had friends that have even made it with milk rather than cream (I still think it&#8217;s best with at least a touch of cream). Can you believe the original recipe says you can use up to 2 cups of cream!? Also, yukon golds do work well and I sometimes use them too.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I loved your soup recipe and the bacon ideas from your bloggers (I added chunky turkey bacon).  I also substituted the cream (I&#8217;m not a fan) with 4oz of Philidelphia cream cheese.  Schlurp &#8230;</p>
<p>The last thing is that Pacific Natural Foods now sells 4 packs of  1 cup stock packs (chicken, veg and beef).  I have no association with the company.  It&#8217;s very useful, you don&#8217;t end up with half a huge pack of stock in your fridge which I tend to throw out before I use.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I made this for a family game night at our place.  I substituted low-fat half and half, added a little leftover ham to the soup and caramelized the onion and leeks a bit more than you call for.  It was very easy to prepare, and the food processor made short work of the prep time.  </p>
<p>It was a big hit.  I&#8217;m fortunate to have a bit leftover for lunch over the next couple of days.  Thanks for sharing.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Just had to say thanks for a great and simple recipe. I also added a little crumbled bacon and used fat free half and half as well. I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of Russet. I made it as part of a Valentine&#8217;s Day dinner for my wife and she loved it. My kids also enjoyed it. And the next day, it made a great lunch. A few splashes of hot sauce perks it up a bit too. I use Goya for that finishing touch. Our main course was Lobster Francaise. There was a great recipe for it at the noted website but there are 2 omissions in the listed recipe. But I saw it prepared on TV and can fill in the blanks. The website says 1/4 white wine and 1/4 butter. It should read 1/4 cup and 1/4 stick.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I needed a recipe for potato leek and this one came up. Nice presentation. I made it with russets with skin on, but ended up removing 2/3 of the skins before serving, which worked well I think. The skins give a nice flavor, there were just too many, and they are easy to remove. I made it with 2 tablespoons butter and maybe 3 tablespoons bacon drippings, which was delicious. I added white pepper as well, which works well, and garnished with some chopped Italian parsley. Just some ideas. Thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This is a fantastic looking recipe!  I&#8217;m not following it exactly right now, as I only had one leek, so I added some onion and celery and also a small amount of chopped up carrot (no broth in house!).  I also cooked in a tablespoon or two of chopped parsley and will use the rest for garnish.  Nest time, I will try it almost exactly like your recipe, though.  I am looking forward to making this in our family&#8217;s cabin in Norway.  I used Asterix potatoes, which are little red ones that hold their firm texture beautifully in soups.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I had made a potato leek soup a while back and it was very involved (and I ruined it with the wrong amount of rosemary- that is one touchy herb); I haven&#8217;t tried the soup since. I recently started receiving a box of local organic veggies each week and am enjoying the challenge of coming up or finding new great recipes (or revisiting old ones). And when this last box had leeks, I searched for another recipe&#8230;this is GREAT!! I love the simple list of ingredients and only dirtying one pan!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>We&#8217;ve had a breakthrough! After attempting rice cereal, oatmeal, apples, pears, sweet potatoes, baked potatoes, all with no more than a solitary taste- my 7th month old son apparently has a more complicated palate&#8230;he seemed to really enjoy the Potato Leek Soup we had for dinner tonight!  We all loved the soup!  Thanks for sharing the recipe- it will be a standard in our home!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This recipe is amazing. Everyone speaks of the comfort it brings during the winter-days, but It has been raining in Denver everyday for weeks and this soup kept us all content and alive. We added a thin layer of shredded imported Swiss cheese to the top. Excellent!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I stumbled across this recipe while looking for a use for the leeks I received in my produce box this week.  I added cooked white (northern) beans and some leftover ham to make it a complete meal (protein) and help stretch it across a few days.  Used lowfat milk, since that&#8217;s all I had, and added some extra butter in the beginning &#8211; excellent soup!!!  My additions made it feel and taste like a fully-loaded baked potato!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I saw leeks at Wal-mart and even tho I&#8217;ve only bought leeks like maybe once in my lifetime&#8230;.I thought&#8230;I&#8217;d like some potato leek soup  (also something I have only had once in my lifetime)  most of the bunches only had two in them  but I found a bunch with three so bargain minded that I am  I grabbed it.  Used one leek in a roasted vegetables dish the first night&#8230;then today  I thought Okay !  Today is the day to make potato leek soup..It is the middle of summer here in Florida and I had been putting up mangoes all day (freezing) from off our mango tree and made a mango ginger salad dressing &#8230; and It was a little overcast&#8230;It&#8217;s been raining here a lot.. That&#8217;s the only thing I can think of that would make me want to make soup&#8230;..  but got online and googled Potato Leek Soup and I read a short quip that you had about your Mom&#8230;as Family recipes are also important to me ..I was intrigued.  And I also like recipes that are simple with  few ingredients, yet delicious&#8230;So I decided to make yours..  I had bought a ten pound bag of Mother Earth Fresh Russet potatoes  from Sam&#8217;s club..so I was in business.  The only thing I didn&#8217;t have on hand was the cream&#8230;but I did have half and half as I buy it at Sam&#8217;s also in the quart size for our coffee..  I used 8 potatos, 2 leeks and one vidalia onion.. and 2 cups of half and half&#8230;I didn&#8217;t have a potato masher so I used a whisk which worked well.. I also used my stainless steel pressure cooker  to cook it in..I didn&#8217;t pressure cook it ..just used it because it keeps things from burning as it has a thicker bottom&#8230;I used a glass lid to keep the steam in as the potatoes cooked.. It turned out excellent!  and it was soo good I sat down and read all the reviews as I ate my bowl&#8230; I had to go get another 1/2 bowl to finish the reviews with!  My husband said it tasted very good!  That&#8217;s high marks for him!  Thank you for sharing the story and the recipe&#8230;and I will definitely give credit to &#8220;K&#8221; as this is her recipe&#8230;What does the K stand for by the way..  My Mother&#8217;s name was  Kathryn Joyce.. she went by Joyce but signed her name as K. Joyce&#8230;..That&#8217;s why I am interested in knowing what the K stands for&#8230;  Thanks again!!  What a living legacy to your Mom,  even from people that had never met her!!!</p>

We have leeks galore out in our garden this year, along with a large harvest of onions and Yukon Gold potatoes. How fun to use all these home and organically grown ingredients in one perfect soup. I did not have cream on hand, so I used milk instead with results that were still wonderful. Definitely a keeper.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I tried this soup earlier this year and liked it, but found it a bit too thin the first time (I posted a comment back then too).  Just recently I gave it another try, made sure not to overdo the stock (and used stock with lots of flavour), and added less cream (only about 100 ml, or a bit under 1/2 cup).  It was PERFECT!!!  I haven&#8217;t been able to stop thinking about this wonderful soup since then&#8230; I&#8217;m about to make it again!!  Thank you for a wonderful, simple, beautiful recipe that will definitely be one of my standards from now on!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I grew leeks this year with this recipe in mind.  My mom used to make wonderful potato leek soup but I never got the recipe from her.  So today I went out and harvested some of my leeks and made this.  I do remember she used some hot curry in hers though so I added some in.  The soup turned out beautifully and is even a pretty yellowish color. I think my mom would agree I did a good job.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I came across this recipe a while back, and have been making it ever since-summer, winter, spring, fall!!!  My daughter loves it, and I eat it for left-overs all week.  For this reason, I usually wing the portions to make a huge batch.  In fact, I have just made a huge batch and took out some of the thickness, added lots of sharp cheddar and white wine, and have made a dip to bring to Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>I do have a question however; how well does this soup freeze?</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>As I can&#8217;t follow a recipe to save my life (intentionally so) I will be adding dungeness crab, Garlic, Red Peppers, Anaheim Chilies, basil, parsley, and maybe some fresh tumeric.  I guess it&#8217;ll be more of a chowder, but having never made a potato leek soup, your recipe seems to be a good base I can start from.  Thanx.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Hi pinchmysalt!<br />
I wanted to make potato leek soup for my friends one night, so I googled &#8220;potato leek soup&#8221; and your recipe was the first hit. I have since made this soup for all my friends and family, and everyone is obsessed with it! As a &#8220;professional student&#8221; without a lot of money to throw around, and this recipe is inexpensive and feeds me for a week! Thanks so much for posting it <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . I have since tried your pumpkin scones as well. As a seasoned scone maker and Victorianist, I must say they are a great twist on a classic. Love them!<br />

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Thank you Kat!  I had some friends over a few days ago, and found your recipe online (had some leftover leeks I wanted to use).  Not only were your directions the most complete and easy to follow of any I found online, but the soup was AMAZING, and honestly the best potato/leek soup I&#8217;ve ever had!  All my friends were raving, and couldn&#8217;t believe I had made it from scratch.  Thank you so much for sharing your Mom&#8217;s delicious recipe with all of us&#8230;</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I chose your (or rather, your mom&#8217;s) recipe last night due to the simplicity and straightforwardness of it.</p>
<p>I  added two chopped and browned strips of bacon to the recipe (as the first step) as my only change, and although great in concept, it would have been better as a garnish. Soup was a hit and I will definitely make it again though I may blend some of it as I like it a little smoother.</p>
<p> I&#8217;m sure your mom is proud of you for sharing such a wonderful thing- thank you for making that decision so the rest of us get to enjoy it!</p>

Otherwise, followed your recipe &#8211; used russet potatos, didn&#8217;t peel them, mashed them into a kind of rough texture.  It is delicious!

 thanks for sharing your recipe, I&#8217;ve been waiting for a dear friend of mines (who happens to be a chef) to prepare some potato soup for me. Days turned into weeks and my craving was getting stronger but he was moving slower. So he turned me on to this web site and I ran across your moms recipe. Needless to say I whipped it right up and my kids loved it so much I barely got a bowl for myself.  Thanks again and God Bless&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

It was a cold freezing rain/sleety day here in NY, so I knew today was the day to make it.  It came out deliciious and my whole family, including my 2 year old daughter loved it.  The only things I changed was that I added celery (just because I had some that I needed to use up) and I used 4 russets and 4 small yukon golds.  I also had some prosciutto in my fridge so I minced that up and added that in as well.  And used half-and-half instead of heavy cream since that&#8217;s what I had in the fridge.  It turned out fantastic and can&#8217;t wait to have some for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!!  I&#8217;ll definitely be reading more of your blog in the future!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Just wanted to say thanks for okaying my inclination to not peel my potatoes.  I&#8217;ve never eaten or made this soup before, but faced with both potatoes and leeks from my CSA box, I thought I&#8217;d give it a go. However, all the recipes I could find said to peel the potatoes, and I hate to do that since they pack such a nutritional punch.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I absolutely love this soup.  So does my family.  I think that the butter and cream are essential &#8211; they add that oomph to the soup.  Everyone is so &#8220;healthy&#8221; when they cook that they have completely forgotten that cream and butter IS healthy &#8211; in moderation.  Also, the combination of these particular ingredients fills you up and keeps you satisfied for hours.  You will not be reaching for bread after an hour.<br />
I always liquidise my leek and potato soup and peel my potatoes.  I think that I really like the colour when liquidised!  Next time I make this I will leave the skins on but still liquidise.  Thanks for a fantastic blog.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Nicole,<br />
My family has made potato leek soup with wild leeks that we would go out and pick while camping.  Such wonderful memories this soup stirs up in me every time I make it which is why your story about your Mom touched me.  Your recipe is simply delicious and I made it using wild leeks <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   Know that many of us appreciate the fact that you posted such a special recipe.  I know it brought tears to my eyes.<br />
Warm Hugs,<br />

Living in western Pennsylvania, we have a great supply of wild leeks.  I froze about 20 pounds from spring, and just used more of my surplus up tonight.  Once again, thank you for sharing.</p>

She adds about a cup of sour cream instead of heavy cream after she removes it from the heat, and adds Dill and 1/2 inch cubes of cheddar cheese&#8230;it is the BEST!</p>
<p>This soup tastes even better after sitting in the fridge overnight and reheated the next day!</p>

<p>What a lovely recipe and story! Thank you for sharing..<br />
Does anyone happen to know how many people this soup serves? I would like to make for a group of 10. I am pretty sure this recipe would serve about 4ish&#8230;but would like to make sure.<br />
Any insight would be much appreciated <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Nicole, how blessed I was to find this recipe online! We have an annual Family &amp; Friends&#8217; Thanksgiving Soup Supper potluck on Friday evening after Thanksgiving. It&#8217;s a time for fun, food, fellowship &amp; thanksgiving. It has become a tradition we all enjoy. I decided that I needed to make a new soup this year. My nieces, ages 4 &amp; 9, helped me find your recipe online. We had a memorable time slicing up the leeks &amp; going over the recipe. The 4-year-old was so cute standing on a chair with her larger-than-her apron on &amp; I gave her the &#8220;job&#8221; of separating the sliced leeks! Obviously not necessary but it gave her something to do to be involved! The other niece was instructing us on what to do next. The soup was a hit at the vegetarian potluck! We probably had about 75 people there! When we got home, I read that this was your Mom&#8217;s recipe. Very moving for me since the recipe I usually make for this event, corn chowder, is my Mom&#8217;s recipe which I love. It sounds like your Mom is no longer with us &amp; mine is sadly not a part of my life. We both have the loss of moms in common. But we also each have our Mom&#8217;s soup recipes which we can share. That is a blessing. Thank you for sharing something dear to you &amp; from your heart. It touched mine. Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

Put everything through the blender and came out with a delicious soup! I might try adding some cream later to see how it does with / without, but even without this is mouthwatering and soul-warming!

After the soup was finished, the soup looked like only potatoes and leeks&#8211;the onion and celery had liquified.  He also added a dash of garlic salt.  Yummy.  Rave reviews from family, friends and neighbors.  I&#8217;ve always thought his split pea was the best, but this is a close second.</p>
