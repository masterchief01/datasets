<h2>What if Your Reading Speed Was The One Thing
  Holding You Back?</h2>
<p>Today the average job requires 30 times the reading compared to 10 years ago. And in another 10 years it will require 30 times as much again. Unfortunately, if you can&#8217;t keep up with the reading, you simply have to settle for a lower-paid job. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s knowledge-economy, knowledge is the most valuable commodity. And it&#8217;s absolutely essential that all adults and children have the reading skills to take control of information overload. </p>
<h2>Faster Reading Statistically Guarantees You Will Become More Successful In Your Career</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a fact. The faster you read, the faster you will process emails.   The easier you stay up-to-date with your training. And the better you   will perform at work. Today we live in a &quot;knoweldge economy&quot;, which   means that &quot;knowledge is money&quot;. The more you know the more you are   worth. Slow reading will prevent you knowing what you need to know in   order to truly succeed. Fast reading, on the other hand, will make   success in any career or study &quot;almost effortless&quot;.</p>
<h2>That&#8217;s Why We Created 7 Speed Reading Software!</h2>
<p>From: Marc Slater, Director &#8211; eReflect Software </p>

No matter what position you are currently in, this information applies to you. You&#8217;re going to learn how to read three times faster, comprehend more, and develop an almost photographic memory for everything you read.</p>
<p><strong>You’ll easily triple your reading speed and increase your comprehension so you can: </strong> </p>
<ul class="normal">
  <li><strong>Take control of &#8220;information overload&#8221; &#8211; </strong> No more feeling pressured under piles of papers, books, and manuscripts.

    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Save time &#8211; and lots of it</strong> &#8211; Spend time with your family, loved ones, and friends instead of reading at a snail&#8217;s pace.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Feel energized and inspired &#8211; </strong>Allow your knowledge to feed your inspiration.
    <p></p>

                    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>You won&#8217;t come close to your reading potential with only a few basic software activities.</p>
                    <p>Until now, speed reading software has failed to deliver, because even the most expensive programs only gave you 4 activities&#8230; meaning that only a very small part of your potential was realized. </p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> 7-Speed-Reading gives you 15 separate training activities, each scientifically designed to work on a<em> separate aspect</em> of your reading and comprehension.</p>
                    <p class="small-text"><a href="wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/Chunk-Expander-Full.png" ><img src="wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/Chunk-Expander-600.png" height="457" width="600" alt="" /></a><br />
                      Above: Scientifically designed software activities remove your bad reading habits <em>automatically</em></p>
                    <p>7-Speed reading is the only program to train you in all the areas you need to reach your potential, including:</p>
                    <ul class="normal">
                      <li><strong>Subvocalization Elimination</strong> &#8211; This means not &#8220;saying the words in your head&#8221; as you read them. <br />
                        <br />
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Regression Elimination</strong> &#8211; This means not unnecessarily going back over what you read. <br />
                        <br />
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Fixation Expansion</strong> &#8211; this means learning to recognize large chunks of words together.<br />
                        <br />
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Eye Muscle Fitness</strong> &#8211; 7-Speed-Reading trains your eyes like a gym trains your muscles. <br />
                        <br />

                        <br />
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Optic-Nerve Maximization</strong> &#8211; Optimize the path between your eyes and your brain.<br />
                        <br />
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Information Processing</strong> &#8211; Speed the rate at which your brain can process new information.<br />
                        <br />
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Memory</strong> &#8211; Develop an <em>almost photographic</em> memory for everything you read.<br />

                    </ul>

                      Above: Each activity works on a separate aspect of your reading and comprehension &#8211; meaning your reading improves faster and more easily than ever before.</p>
                    <p ><strong>The result:</strong> Each training &#8220;compounds&#8221; on the one before, giving you a 3X -10X boost in reading speed while increasing your comprehension. Never before has it been so easy to boost your reading speed so quickly and easily with a single software program.</p>

<!-- #FAQs -->
<h2 class="center" style="padding-bottom:10px;">Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
<strong>Do I need to know a lot about computers?</strong>
<p >Absolutely not! 7-Speed-Reading has been designed from the ground up to be easy to use and requires no technical knowledge. It can be downloaded and installed in a few clicks. You also get unlimited access to our support team should you need any help.<br />
  <a href="order_7sr_main.html" rel="nofollow external" >Click Here To Download 7-Speed-Reading Now </a></p>
<strong>Does reading faster reduce my comprehension?</strong>
<p >Absolutely not! Most research indicates that reading faster  actually increases your comprehension rather than reduces it. The faster you read, the easier your brain will be able to form a &#8220;complete picture&#8221; of the material, which  increases comprehension. When reading highly technical material (such as scientific studies or engineering textbooks) it will sometimes be necessary to &#8220;pause&#8221; to ponder a concept. However, this is not the same as slower reading. The people with the best comprehension read fast, and then occasionally pause when necessary.<br />

<p >7-Speed-Reading is not &#8220;shareware&#8221;. Rather, it is a professional product that has had a large sum of money invested into it.
