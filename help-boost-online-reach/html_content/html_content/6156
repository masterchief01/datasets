<p>I'm not sure I'll ever quite tire of the magical combination of garlic and chile&mdash;when a recipe begins with a little olive oil and garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, I know we're off to a good start. I'm even more inclined when the involved recipe requires about 10 minutes of cooking and hardly any chopping to boot.</p>

<p>I pulled this one from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470423544/serieats-20">So Easy</a> by Ellie Kreiger, which is full of health-conscious recipes that pack a lot of flavor. <strong>Healthy it might have been, but more importantly, delicious</strong>. Even though it's December and the snow has been falling furiously in Chicago, the sweet bursts of the grape tomatoes (which tend to be pretty tasty even through the winter months compared to regular tomatoes) and fragrant basil brought to mind a summer picnic.</p>
