<p>Intimidated by baking, assembling, and decorating a homemade red velvet cake for Valentine&#8217;s Day?  Give cupcakes a try instead!</p>
<p>As you probably know, I have already written about my husband&#8217;s family recipe for a gorgeous <a title="Red Velvet Cake recipe" href="http://pinchmysalt.com/2008/11/10/red-velvet-cake-recipe/" target="_blank">Red Velvet Cake</a>.  But when I noticed that lots of readers were asking questions about how to turn the cake recipe into a cupcake recipe, I decided it was time to give it a try myself!<span id="more-1929"></span></p>
<p>At first I was going to try a version using less red food coloring than the cake recipe, but at the last minute I decided to stay true to the original.  These aren&#8217;t pink, they aren&#8217;t reddish-brown, they are a dramatic RED, perfect for Valentine&#8217;s Day!  And in addition to the beautiful color, these little cakes are light, tender, and downright delicious!</p>
<p>There are several different types of red velvet cake. Some are heavier on the chocolate flavor than others, some use less food coloring, and some use beets instead of artificial coloring.  This one does not taste like a chocolate cake, although there is a subtle hint of cocoa.  The flavor is unique and delicious, and I prefer it to the red velvet cakes that contain more cocoa powder.  And as I&#8217;ve already mentioned, this cake recipe does not shy away from the food coloring!</p>
<p>Although red velvet cake is definitely a Southern tradition, it&#8217;s popularity has never been limited to the South.  The recipe I&#8217;m going to share today is also called Waldorf-Astoria Cake, and is supposedly based on a red velvet cake that was popular at the New York hotel in the 1920&#8242;s. For more on the history of red velvet cake, check out this great <a title="Red Velvet Cake article at the New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/dining/14velv.html?ex=1329109200&amp;en=30b25927180258c1&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss" target="_blank">New York Times article</a>.</p>
<p>But regardless of where the cake originated, red velvet cakes and cupcakes have become an American tradition that is holding on strong.  Whether it&#8217;s Christmas, Valentine&#8217;s Day, a birthday, or even a wedding day, red velvet is a wonderful way to celebrate!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1932" title="Red Velvet Cupcake Bite" src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img_3404-version-2-1.jpg" alt="Red Velvet Cupcake Bite" width="549" height="366" /></p>
<p><strong>Red Velvet Cupcakes</strong></p>
<p>2 1/2 cups sifted cake flour*<br />
1 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1 teaspoon salt<br />
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder<br />
2 oz. red food coloring (two bottles)<br />
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened<br />
1 1/2 cups sugar<br />
2 eggs, at room temperature<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature<br />
1 teaspoon white vinegar<br />
1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two 12-cup muffin tins with cupcake papers.</p>
<p>2. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl; set aside.  In a small bowl, mix food coloring and cocoa powder to form a thin paste without lumps; set aside.</p>
<p>3. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about three minutes.  Beat in eggs, one at a time, then beat in vanilla and the red cocoa paste, scraping down the bowl with a spatula as you go.  Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beat well, then beat in half of the buttermilk. Beat in another third of flour mixture, then second half of buttermilk. End with the last third of the flour mixture, beat until well combined, making sure to scrape down the bowl with a spatula.</p>
<p>4. In a small bowl, mix vinegar and baking soda.  Yes, it will fizz!  Add vinegar mixture to the cake batter and stir well to combine. Using an ice cream scoop, fill cupcake cups with cake batter (they should be 2/3 &#8211; 3/4 full).  You may not fill all the cups, I ended up with 20 cupcakes.  Place muffin tins on the middle rack of a preheated 350 degree oven.  Bake for approximately 20-22 minutes, rotating pans halfway through. Cupcakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Check early and don&#8217;t overbake!</p>
<p>5. Cool the cupcakes in their tins on a wire rack for 10 minutes then remove and allow to cool completely before frosting.  Frost cupcakes with cream cheese icing (recipe below) and decorate with <a title="Wilton Sweetheart Sprinkles at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VMB38?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pimysa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000VMB38" target="_blank">red sprinkles</a> if desired.  The cupcakes above were decorated using the <a title="Wilton Cupcake Decorating Kit at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NBNHT2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pimysa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000NBNHT2" target="_blank">Wilton Cupcake Decorating Kit</a> and <a title="Wilton Sprinkles at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VMB38?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pimysa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000VMB38" target="_blank">Valentine&#8217;s Sprinkles.</a> They can usually be found at craft stores like Michaels or Joann.</p>
<p>6. Enjoy the cupcakes with those you love!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1947" title="Cupcake Wrapper" src="http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img_3416-version-2.jpg" alt="Cupcake Wrapper" width="550" height="366" /></p>
<p><strong>Recipe Notes</strong>: *Sift cake flour once before measuring, then sift again with the other dry ingredients per recipe instructions. Wear an apron and be careful with the red food coloring&#8211;no matter how hard I try, I always end up staining something!  As you&#8217;re mixing the cake batter, use a spatula to scrape down the bowl frequently throughout the entire process.  Since the batter is fairly thick, I have found that an <a title="Ice Cream Scoop at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004OCIW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pimysa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004OCIW" target="_blank">old-fashioned ice cream scoop</a> works best for filling the cupcake wells (also great for muffin batter!).  Since all ovens are different, make sure you check the cupcakes a little early.  Mine were ready in just over 2o minutes, yours may be done sooner, or they may take a minute or two longer.</p>
<p><strong>Cream Cheese Frosting</strong></p>
<p>16 oz. cream cheese (2 packages), softened<br />
1/2 cup unsalted butter (one stick), softened<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted<br />
pinch of salt</p>
<p>With an electric mixer, blend together cream cheese and butter until smooth.  Turn mixer to low speed and blend in powdered sugar, salt and vanilla extract.  Turn mixer on high and beat until light and fluffy. Use immediately or refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.  If refrigerated, the frosting will need to be brought to room temperature before using (after frosting softens up, beat with mixer until smooth).</p>
<p><strong>Recipe Notes:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter and/or stiffer frosting, more powdered sugar can be added (up to four cups). But remember, the more sugar you add, the less you&#8217;ll be able to taste the tangy cream cheese!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This is an awesome idea for Valentines day.  Maybe I&#8217;ll make some to surprise the girlfriend.  I tried a red velvet cake a few weeks ago and I found it helpful to measure the flour by weight instead of by volume, that way you only need to sift once and can be exact.</p>
<p>Cupcakes look awesome!<br />

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m planning to do a (gluten-free) red velvet cupcake for a valentines day post- this is great inspiration! I&#8217;ll probably do a beet version. It sounds good to me and I already have beets in my fridge, perfect for dye. I am reassured that these cupcakes don&#8217;t have to taste strongly of chocolate as I&#8217;m not that crazy about chocolate cake&#8230; Great post all around! <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<b>Nick:</b> You&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s always best to measure flour by weight when baking. But since most Americans are used to measuring only by volume, I&#8217;ve always written my recipes this way. <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />   How&#8217;d your cake come out?<br />
<b>Recipe Girl:</b> I know, I ate way too many myself on Superbowl Sunday!<br />
<b>Alyce:</b> Yes, your 7-layer cake is absolutely beautiful! I made chocolate muffins with beet puree and they were really good (didn&#8217;t taste like beets at all)!  <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
<b>Seamaiden:</b> I&#8217;m thinking about trying a new version of Red Velvet Cupcakes using beets, just because I&#8217;m curious about it. I made Beet Chocolate Muffins a couple years ago and they were great!  The link for them is at the bottom of the post if you want to check them out.<br />
<b>Ben:</b> You&#8217;re not the only one! <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
<b>Panini Kathy:</b> There&#8217;s nothing wrong with making something special for yourself for Valentine&#8217;s Day (or any day for that matter)!

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This is hilarious:  I was at the grocery store to get the ingredients to make your Chocolate Stout cupcakes when I suddenly remembered reading your Red Velvet cake recipe and I decided to make that instead.  But I still wanted to do cupcakes, and when I got home and checked your website &#8211; voila!  You&#8217;ve just put up a recipe for red velvet cupcakes!  Amazing!  I&#8217;m so excited to try these.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b>Erin C</b> Two eggs, at room temperature (it&#8217;s on the list)<br />
<b>Sara:</b> If you google &#8220;Waldorf-Astoria Cake&#8221; you&#8217;ll find lots of recipes with this amount of red food coloring.  Many of the newer recipes have reduced the amount. I agree that it&#8217;s a lot, but we don&#8217;t eat these very often so I don&#8217;t worry too much about it.  I just love the color of the finished cake/cupcakes!  <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
<b>Kristy:</b> I hate refrigerated cakes/cupcakes so I don&#8217;t frost them until the day they will be eaten. You can make the cupcakes a day ahead of time and store them in an airtight container and then frost them the next day if necessary. I think they are fine left at room temperature for a day, but if you have leftover frosted cupcakes, you should probably refrigerate them.  If you do have to refrigerate them, let them come back to room temperature before eating or the cake texture will seem terrible.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Yum!  I think I might make some of these for Valentine&#8217;s Day.  I actually tried the Sprinkles mix a few weeks ago. It&#8217;s not cheap at $14. and it basically just consists of the dry ingredients &#8211; you still have to add the butter, eggs and vinegar &#8211; and you have to make your own frosting.  It was fun to try though, and they did come out just like the ones at the store!</p>

It went find, although, I only used about 2 tsp. of food coloring. The cake was red and we can feel food coloring in our mouth (maybe it&#8217;s difference between Thai&#8217;s food coloring and US&#8217;, I have no clue on that)</p>
<p>I love the color but I&#8217;m stuck with the problem that nobody in my family will eat them. They&#8217;re all afraid of toxic. sob :&#8217;(</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I love Red Velvet and made these cupcakes for my Valentine but they turned out dry and dense. I baked another batch, doubling the butter and alternately folding instead of beating in the flour and buttermilk and they came out delicious!<br />
I also doubled the cocoa to suit my taste, and used only 2 tablespoons of red food coloring which worked out just fine.<br />
I&#8217;ve tried lots of red velvet recipes including the more natural beet versions which tasted deliciously earthy and were super moist but without the trademark artificial hue.<br />
I know a lot of Red Velvet recipes call for lard &#8211; has anyone tried it?</p>

I told you I wasn&#8217;t a baker. Totally forgot the eggs, had set them by the stove to get to room temp, and having such fun with red batter&#8230;completely forgot them. Put the cupcakes in the oven, shut the door, stood up and saw the eggs. So, opened the door, scraped all the batter back into bowl and beat the you know what out of the eggs in to the batter added the vanilla and put back in pan and back in oven. And the icing was divine as well! They were a huge hit!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I thought these might be fun to make for my 8 year old son&#8217;s class Valentine party. He came home to tell me that he was the only one to eat them. I guess the other kids were a bit alarmed by the red color and most of the cupcakes ended up in the garbage although I guess the Dunkin&#8217; Doughnut holes were a big hit! LOL what are we doing to our kids!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This was delicious!  I&#8217;m made these cupcakes a few times now and there is never any left overs.  I did double the amount of coco powder since I perfer a more chocolate flavor.  I did get food color on my fingers and if you wash your hands right away with hot water they will go away.  If you wait to wash your hands, even 5 mins, they they are going  to be red for a couple days.  The second time I made a batch of these lovely cupcakes I wore gloves while mixing the food coloring with the coco powder.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>wonderful! i&#8217;m new to baking and especially using food dyes, so i wasn&#8217;t sure what type to use (gel/liquid/soft gel). i didn&#8217;t have enough of the liquid or the gel, so i used 1/4 oz liquid + 1 3/4 oz water plus half of a container of gel food dye to get what i thought might give me red velvet cupcakes. i ended up with hot pink velvet cupcakes! they taste great, nonetheless, and in the future i will use 2 oz gel food dye. it just seemed like an awful lot of dye at the time! made them for my little sister&#8217;s 21st birthday <img src='http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  thanks for the recipe! </p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I made this recipe today for my kids&#8217; birthday (they turned 1 and 2) party today. Those were the best muffins I have ever had! I had never had red velvet cake before, so I can&#8217;t compare, but these were seriously moist, delicious in flavor and I loved that as subtle the cocoa was, you could still taste it at the end of the bite, which made it completely decadent. The cream cheese frosting was perfect as is, just tangy enough and sweet enough. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for this recipe, that I will definately be keeping in my favorites for years to come!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I made the red velvet cupcakes today because I always wanted to try this recipe. My husband said they were delicious but expected them to be moister &#8230; he said they were a bit spongey. I never had red velvet cake before (i&#8217;m Jamaican) so I didn&#8217;t know what to compare them too.. Did I do something wrong? Is that suppose to be he texture? Spongey or really moist?</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p><b>Stacey:</b> Some red velvet recipes are very very high in oil, which makes them very moist, but also heavy.  This recipe is more traditional, and I guess it might be a bit spongy in texture.  But the cupcakes are generally very tender without being heavy or oily.  Perhaps they got baked just a few minutes too long, or it may be that your husband is used to a different type of recipe.</p>

<p>P.S: for those in the UK, Sainsburys and Waitrose sell buttermilk-even their small stores!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I just made a half batch of these for the first time with your recipe using regular cupcake size instead of muffin size and they came out really well! It has a dense semi-sweet consistency that I really like and because the cupcake by itself it not too sweet, it should be perfect with the frosting (haven&#8217;t tried the frosting yet)</p>
<p>I also folded the flour and buttermilk together as someone else as suggested and I think this helped. But I would like the center to be somewhat more moist. Anyone have suggestions for how to do this? I don&#8217;t want to undercook it. There seems to be a fine line between gookiness and being overcooked. Will more butter help?</p>

This recipe, however, turned out fantastic.  The only change I made was halving the food coloring.  I didn&#8217;t have (and didn&#8217;t want to spend the money) for two bottles of the stuff.

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I have made your red velvet cake multiple times and it has turned out great (and delish!).  Just this past week, I doubled the recipe to make both a cake and cupcakes.  Once again the cake came out great, but the cupcakes fell flat in the middle.  What did I do wrong?  I googled why cupcakes fall and one possibility is that I over mixed.  I did let the mixer run while I got the cupcake liners in the pan, but considering that the cake came out ok, I don&#8217;t really think that this would be the problem.  I also filled the cupcakes 3/4 full (maybe that is too much?).  Also, my 6 year old did open the oven when they were first put in, but like I have said before, the cake still came out ok. The cupcakes were put on the center rack (and only cooked for 20 min), while the cakes were on the bottom.  The cupcakes still came out moist and tasted great, but were a little embarrasing when I brought them into work and it looked like someone sat on them!  Anyone have any ideas of what I need to do next time to make them look like the pictures that are posted?</p>

The cream cheese frosting os perfect. While in the baking aisle I came across a powdered buttermilk product. I decided to give it a try since I always end up having so much buttermilk leftover.It worked wonderful and now it will have a much longer shelf life!I made these for my Mom&#8217;s birthday and I think she&#8217;ll just love them!

				<span class="comment-body"><p>This recipe worked out fantastically. I compared this to two other recipes online, and this appealed to me the most with photographs and excellent directions. I didn&#8217;t run into a problem at all; the ingredients&#8217; portions worked out well, and so the batter+frostings&#8217; consistency came out perfectly (even w/o an electric mixer on me, haha).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a photo of how my red velvet cupcakes turned out. I took a slightly different approach (1) by adding a chocolate drizzle, (2) by rimming the circumference w/ crushed walnuts, (3) by garnishing w/ sliced strawberry, and (4) by filling the cupcake a bit w/ the cream cheese frosting.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>These are the best&#8230; First time I made it, I did not use cake flour, also, I did not measure  the flour after sifting. So it was little dry. Next time I corrected all this and it came out just perfect. I have made it for large gathering and always get rave reviews. </p>
<p>Have a pic of my cupcakes uploaded on the header of my blog:<br />

				<span class="comment-body"><p>@janice, if you had followed the recipe, if you had found all the ingredients and even put in more cocoa, if almost everyone who attempted this recipe found success, then i think the answer to your question lies in the mirror.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>While I was posting my last comment here, I read Ben&#8217;s comment on using Duncan Hines red cake mix. I wanted to write back there and then that box mixed can never match to &#8216;made from scratch&#8217; cakes, but wanted to try first. So yesterday I got Duncan Hines red velvet cake mix and made it. It tasted like a regular yellow cake with red color in it. It had no other flavor to it. So I can say very confidently now, that this is indeed a great recipe and no, it cannot be replaced with a box recipe.</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I made these today and for the most part I really like the recipe. They didn&#8217;t come out perfectly but I think it is my baking that caused this, not the recipe. First I would like to say the flavor is awesome&#8230;however I did double the vanilla extract. They are very tender but a little bit dry, I think this is because the first time I checked them in the oven (they had cooked for 19 minutes) the toothpick came out perfectly clean and I think maybe they may have actually been ready at 17 minutes or so. I&#8217;m told that Red Velvet cake is touchy to cook and even a few extra minutes will dry it out so I&#8217;m guess that&#8217;s what the problem is. The tender consistency is very nice though. My other problem is that I didn&#8217;t get the nice deep red color but I only had 1 bottle of food coloring and I went to 2 grocery stores and neither carried the liquid, only the gel so I used one bottle of liquid coloring and one tube of gel. Based on previous reviews people who used the gel didn&#8217;t get good results so I&#8217;m assuming that&#8217;s what it is. All in all based on the flavor and tenderness of these cupcakes I will certainly be keeping this recipe and using it again! I can&#8217;t attest to the cream cheese frosting as I&#8217;m using my own recipe for that. Thanks for posting Nicole!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>Just a quick note to add to my above post: on closer inspection of the frosting recipe mine is almost exactly the same with the addition of 2 tablespoons of sour cream and an additional teaspoon of vanilla (totally 2 teaspoons vanilla) but about 1/2 cup less sugar. The cupcake recipe made an even 24 cupcakes however the frosting recipe gave me A LOT of extra frosting (and I&#8217;m pretty generous when I&#8217;m heaping it on) so that&#8217;s something to keep in mind.</p>

It is absolutely the best red velvet cupcake recipe I&#8217;ve found. I highly recommend it! Be sure to follow the steps exactly how they are given and don&#8217;t overcook your cupcakes.

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m recent to the baking of Red Velvet cake/cup cakes, but yours was the first I tried &#8211; my daughter wanted RVCC for her birthday, so I ended up making a double batch, and a half batch a few days later.  They all came out great.  One thing I did try when I did the half batch was to sift the cocoa in with the flour as I wanted to try using concentrated gel coloring instead of the liquid.  Seemed to work fine, although I could have used a touch more of the gel, as the color didn&#8217;t pop quite as well as with the liquid color.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also tried an oil based recipe, which I didn&#8217;t like as much.  The cake was moister, but it didn&#8217;t have tang like yours does.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>I just made these 2 days ago, and I&#8217;m sorry to say that they were terrible! I&#8217;ve been struggling to find a go-to RVCC recipe and was so happy when I friend suggested this one. I made them for a client who was to pick them up that same night, fortunately for me she never showed up because these were just nasty. I think it may have been because I used the Wilton food colouring, though I did use 1 oz no-taste red, and 1 oz christmas-red. I&#8217;m thinking that you use the red folouring found at the grocery store that comes in those squeezy bottles, yes?</p>

				<span class="comment-body"><p>@Esther &#8211; try reducing the cream cheese by an ounce or two.  That should yield a slightly stiffer frosting.  Not sure how it will affect the sweetness.  You could also try refrigerating them first to get the frosting to set up a bit before putting them in the celophane bags.</p>
<p>@Wendy &#8211; The point of using the Wilton concentrated coloring is that you will need to use much less of it to color the cake.  I haven&#8217;t yet hit on the right amount to get the same result as the liquid food coloring, but have been trying between 1 and 2 tsp dissolved in warm water to make up the liquid volume difference.  I&#8217;d had very good results using that technique flavor wise as well as using the specified amount of liquid color.</p>
