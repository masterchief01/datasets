<p>Have you ever wondered what foods have the highest Caloric counts? Have you ever wondered what they foods had the highest calorie count per $1? Well, for the most part these are synonymous. The following is a list of some of the worst foods in the world for you  &#8211; in health terms &#8211; as well as  a breakdown of exactly how you get what you are paying for. After reading this, you &#8216;ll mostly likely vow to never eat these menu items again.</p>

<p>This menu item was long-considered the most unhealthy thing you could eat at in an American restaraunt, until after tons of bad press, Chili&#8217;s removed it permanently from their menu. We felt compelled to add it to this list, because what American can rightfully said they&#8217;ve never had at least one whole Awesome Blossom in their life?</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">Chili&#8217;s Chicken Crisper Tacos (3 pc)</span></h2>

<strong>Calories per $1.00: </strong>225</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;Crisper Tacos, while relatively low in the saturated fat department, make up for this by  having an extremely high calorie and sodium count. Probably best avoided, in favor of a water and some raw veggies&#8230;<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>This &#8220;aussie-tizer&#8221; features more sodium and more fat than any other item still known to be featured on a menu. It is also offers more calories per $1, than any other food we could find. <strong><strong><strong><br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Named by <em>Men&#8217;s Health</em> as the worst food item in the world, this shake is embarrassingly unhealthy. You can expect BR to remove it from their menu by year&#8217;s end. <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>While relatively better than the Oreo shake, this desert is still ridiculously high in saturated fat: 42grams! Don&#8217;t give into this tasty treat&#8217;s subliminally advertised name; it actually ought be avoided. <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>These beer-battered tacos are bad on so many levels. They constitute more than an individual&#8217;s daily caloric intake, more than 2x the suggested daily fat intake, and over 2x as much sodium as a healthy adult should consume in a day. <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>&#8220;Fresh Chicken and Broccoli&#8221; sound like adjectives to describe a healthy meal. It is however, the dubious name of a pasta dish at the Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain.  And they all but fail to mention the overwhelming layer of cheese on the dish &#8211; read the fine print!<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>Talk about pulling the wool over the public&#8217;s eyes; tuna melts are supposed to be healthy. At Quizno&#8217;s they are not. But somehow this is featured on the brand&#8217;s healthy eating menu.

<p>In terms of grams of fat, this is one of the worst items for you in America. If you are going to eat this, try to share it with some friends&#8230;about 6-8 of them. <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>What is more outrageous about this cake: the price, or how bad it is for you? Much like Outback, The Cheesecake Factory is not open about the nutritional information for many of their food items. A good rule of thumb is do not eat something if you do not know how bad it is for you.</p>

<p>One of the best indicators that something is bad for you, is when in the name are these three words in succession:&#8221;triple&#8221; and &#8220;the cheese&#8221;. With that said,  it&#8217;s no wonder this item has more than double what The American Heart Association recommends for  daily sodium intake (2400). <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p><em>&#8220;I want my &#8216;baby back, baby back, baby back&#8230;&#8221;, </em>is most likely what you&#8217;ll be signing if you find yourself eating this on a regular basis. The only problem, is that it will be in reference to your boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse that left you due to your gaining a ton of weight. When I spoke to an Outback manager about the nutritional data, all he could do was advise against ordering the ribs if I was concerned about my diet. <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>This is one of the fattiest food items on this list. Although the pizza referenced in this study is meant for two people, it is not uncommon for an individual to have a &#8216;personal&#8217; pizza to their self. So, it&#8217;s not just a clever name. This &#8216;pie definitely scores scores extremely high in fat, saturated fat, and sodium: eat at your own peril. <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

<p>Even though these sandwiches now typically go for more than $6.00 &#8211; even though the original burger&#8217;s name a stab at &#8216;expensive burgers&#8217; a few years ago &#8211; it packs quite the caloric bang for your buck. At 234 calories per $1, it is towards the higher end of the spectrum. Unfortunately for many, because of the negative publicity this sandwich has received in the last year or so, it has been largely pulled from Carls Jr. menus.</p>

If anybody were that low on the intelligence scale, my friend, your article won't help them, because they likely lack the ability to read also.</p>

		<p>What about The Heart Attack Grille? Surely their menu items top all these? In terms of calories AND bang for your buck!

They have flatliner fries, which is an all you can eat CHEESE coated fries bar, NOT A SALAD BAR!!!

		<p>Tasty food (salty, fat) doesn't mean good food, unless you are a teenager who never really ate anything else.  And "good" food doesn't necessarly means salad and veggies ... Nothing like a good steak, meat balls' spaghetti and pizza .. just not at those places ... its not calories the problem (i.e. eat in moderation), but the sodium content .. scary !</p>

		<p>Just thought you should know that some of your info is outdated.  I work for Ruby Tuesday and we stopped putting the layer of cheese over top of the pasta at least 6 months ago.  I believe that was 2 cups, so that eliminates a lot of calories and fat (although the creamy parmesean sauce is still loaded with both).  Anymore, it is difficult to go to any restaurant and eat healthy.  At least at Ruby's there is a salad bar with low-fat dressings and fresh fruits (although you can certainly load your salad with tons of calories and fat if you choose).  Good article though.</p>

		<p>In terms of caloric efficiency per dollar, none of these items compares with something normally considered a healthy (or at least healthier) food -- rice. I was at Sam's Club last week, and I notice Riceland Enriched Long Grain was sold in 50lb bags. Each bag contained, if I remember right, about 20,000 calories and was being sold for about $15. This works out to more than 1300 calories per dollar. So, I guess the Awesome Blossom has nothing to brag about or apologize for, depending on your point of view.</p>

		<p>Oops, I just found another webpage which indicates there are closer to 80,000 calories in 50lbs of Riceland Rice. At $15 per 50lbs, this works out to a little more than 5,000 calories per dollar. Can anyone confirm these figures are correct, or does anyone know of any food more calorically dense per dollar of cost than rice?</p>

[gallery]



Manolith had the pleasure of talking to hottie Carol Zara from DigitallyBlonde.com. As one of G4 TV\'s Women of the Web, Carol has conquered the hearts and pants of geeks in the Twitter-sphere. If you want to see her in action, she\'ll be in attendance at Wizard World Toronto this Saturday and Sunday.

M: Hey Carol, we\'re glad to finally honor you as this week\'s Chickolith, how does it feel?

CZ: It feels… or-gas-mic! (comes back 15 minutes later)

M: First off, we gotta ask you, do you use the blonde keyboard?

CZ: I have to admit, my life wouldn’t be the same without “made for blonde” products. I don’t just have a blonde keyboard, but also a blonde remote control and even a rubik’s cube for blondes.

M: Ok, ok, let\'s be serious, if Manolith was a real dude, would you be attracted to him?

CZ: Obvs… First because his name starts with “man” (these things are very important for a girl nowadays) and second because he’s got the hottest package, ahem, I mean content, out there.

M: How\'d you get started with DigitallyBlonde.com?

CZ: I got bored of spying on my hot neighbor, so I decided to start my own website. Just like everyone else.

M: Ok, time to get physical, who is your dream guy... or girl (Borat voice \Very Nice\)

CZ: Well, if I had to have a threesome with guys, I’d choose Johnny Depp and Michael Bay. If it was with girls, definitely Olivia Munn and Megan Fox. Oh, wait! Did you mean people I’ve never kissed before?

M: What do you see yourself doing in 10 years?

CZ: I see myself having lots of sex hopefully.

M: What\'s the craziest thing you\'ve ever done on your website or ever?

CZ: It was accidentally letting my Twitter followers know that I was tweeting naked... like 5 times…

M: Do you have any cyber stalkers? Haha you thought we were going to say something else.

CZ: Actually I don’t get your joke, but I’ll answer your question. I’m not sure. In fact, I’d like to use this space to ask politely Manolith’s writers to stop emailing me pics of their penises... I will end up falling in love with you guys, which is no good as I live in Canada. We all know long distance relationships just don\'t work. The distance will leave me horny &amp; heartbroken.

M: And finally, why do you live in Canada?

CZ: I was born in Brazil (The horniest country in the world, woohoo!) and I chose to come to Canada because I read on Wikipedia that Canada has one of the largest populations of male virgins in the world." href="/chickolith-interview-with-carol-zara"><span class="photo watermark"></span><img src="http://cache.static.tsavo.com/wordpress/uploads/2010/03/Carol-sm.jpg" alt="Chickolith - Interview with Carol Zara"/></a></li><li><a rel="Entertainment|Esquire Interview - Sexiest Woman Alive Madness |Esquire knows a thing or two about hot chicks. The magazine\'s annual Sexiest Woman Alive picks include spot-on selections like Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Scarlett Johansson, Charlize Theron and Halle Berry. So yea, Esquire sure can choose \'em.

But this year they\'re mixing it up a bit. Esquire will still name the Sexiest Woman Alive in November, but they\'ve given the rest of us a chance to get in on the action too, March bracket-style.

Sexiest Woman Alive Madness is a 64-entrant tournament of babes that features stunning birds from four regions: sports, television, movies and music &amp; fashion. All the ladies are ranked, the matchups are set and upsets are already in the works. To get the inside skinny on this single-elimination death match, we interviewed the editor of the piece, Peter Martin.

CS: How did you select the 64 participants for the single-elimination tournament?

PM: One of those big lottery wheels, with one ball for every woman in the world. (It was a big wheel). That, and a lot of time on Google image search.

CS: How did you decide on the rankings?

PM: This was tough. And occasionally the cause of much debate. Many of them had to be massaged a little bit to get the match-ups we thought would inspire people.

CS: Olivia Wilde and Olivia Munn as underdogs - what’s up with that?

PM: It’s something about Olivias. You’ll notice Olivia Newton John didn’t even make the list. Not a coincidence.

CS: Who do you think will take the first round match-up between mad men hotties Christina Hendricks and January Jones?

PM: I wish they both could win, but my gut says Hendricks.

CS: Which Heidi Montag do you think will advance passed the first round – the schnaz next door or the cut-up plastic freakshow?

PM: As he tends to be, I think Billy Bush was the bellwether here. People prefer old Heidi.

CS: What’s the deal with including Lane Kiffin in the tourney?

PM: Like many of our favorite women, he’s feisty and unpredictable. Also, he’s pretty.

CS: Does Helen Mirren have a chance against Megan Fox?

PM: You might want to check the score and flip the question. Mirren’s making a very strong—and deserved—run.

CS: Do you really think Anne Hathaway looks like a woodland animal?

PM: Only in the eyes. And not any woodland animal. Tapirs are weird looking.

CS: Who do you like to win it all?

PM: That’s kind of like asking god who his chosen people are. My bible knowledge isn’t too vast, but I’m pretty sure he begged off of that question, too.

We all know your other bracket\'s already busted, but the madness of March can continue. Head over to Esquire.com and start voting. Tip the scales in the understandably close contest between Eva Mendes and Sienna Miller. Find out who\'s kicking ass (yea Minka), and who\'s getting trounced (sorry Serena). See if Helen Mirren\'s amazing breasts can upset top seed Megan Fox\'s goofy thumbs. You can print out the brackets here and here or pick up a new Esquire on March 23. This tourney\'s going to take awhile to unfold, so make sure you check back and get your votes in for each round.

In case you\'re wondering just how sexy the Sexiest Woman Alive has to be, here\'s a look at last year\'s honoree:

" href="/esquire-sexiest-woman-alive-madness-interview"><span class="photo watermark"></span><img src="http://cache.static.tsavo.com/wordpress/uploads/2010/03/chris-sm.jpg" alt="Esquire Interview - Sexiest Woman Alive Madness "/></a></li><li><a rel="Girls|18 of Bollywood's Hottest Leading Ladies|Bollywood is becoming more mainstream these days thanks to shows like \So You Think You Can Dance\ and movies like \Slumdog Millionaire,\ but being a Bollywood star is no easy feat. These women don\'t just have to act, they are also expected to sing (or lip sync) and dance, needing to be in peak physical condition to be at the top of their game and worthy of the spotlight. We hope you enjoy our list and discover a few new hotties you’ve never heard of.
Kajol


Source
Kajol made her acting debut in 1992 in Bollywood alongside Shahrukh Khan and has since built her reputation as one of India\'s most successful and talented actresses. More recently, she starred in the come-back feature \My Name is Khan,\ which did very well in India, and even found some success in North America. She is also known for proudly sporting one very unique physical characteristic (a la Frida Kahlo), do you know what it is? (Check for yourself here, sans la photoshop.)
Aishwarya Rai


Source
Known as the \most beautiful woman in the world,\ Ashwarya started her career as Miss World in 1996, and that was just the beginning. Since then she has become a mainstay of the Bollywood scene, keeping her body in great shape in the process. In a more recent blockbuster, \Dhoom 2,\ she said she had to work out for 8-10 hours a day! Check out a clip here.
Sushmita Sen


Source
Sushmita Sen was the first Indian woman to be crowned Miss Universe in 1994, and for good reason. More recently, it\'s been rumored this Bollywood-beauty will take a fast career turn from her normal, light-hearted roles to play a more serious part in a film portraying the life of the great Benazir Bhutto.
Preity Zinta


Source
This Bollywood hottie is known for her cute dimples and bubbly roles, which would be enough for most, but not Ms. Zinta. She also holds a degree in Criminal Psych, writes a series of columns for BBC News Online South Asia, and is a co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kings XI Punjab! Cute, bubbly, whip-smart and successful!
Shilpa Shetty

Source

Our UK readers best know Shilpa from 2007\'s \Celebrity Big Brother UK,\ in which she, unfortunately, had to deal with both racial tension and discrimination on the show, directed her way primarily from a few housemates. The scandal ended in widespread anger amongst international viewers, especially in India. It wasn\'t, however, until show sponsors began to pull out that \Celeb UK\ finally took action, evicting the offending housemates. Still, a woman of class, as well as beauty, Shilpa went on to win the show with 63% of the final vote and even, eventually, received apologies from two of the three bullies.
Rani Mukerji


Source
Best known for her trademark, husky yet sexy voice, Rani Mukerji doesn\'t disappoint in the looks department either, especially her stunning light-hazel eyes. This, of course, isn\'t too surprising as she comes from a powerhouse family of entertainers, including her first-cousin, Kajol, our top pick.
Amrita Rao


Source
Pursued by filmmakers from a very young age for her natural beauty, Amrita abstained from the world of acting until she had completed her college degree in Psychology first. After finding easy success post-college in modeling, she soon after took her natural place at the top of the Bollywood scene.
Kangana Ranaut

Source
In 2008, this twenty-year-old beauty catapulted onto the stage with the blockbuster Bollywood hit \Fashion.\ Ever since, the eye-friendly actress has taken the lead in a new generation of Bollywood actors, taking over the silver screen by way of a very \western\ cultural phenomena, social media. She currently updates her personal blog regularly, reaching out to fans worldwide, giving them the inside scoop to projects past, present and future.
Dia Mirza


Source
Dia is not only beautiful, to say the least, she also has a great heart and a giving personality. Using her fame for good, Dia has helped many great humanitarian causes gain publicity both in India and worldwide. Very active locally, she has brought much-needed awareness to several important issues, causes and organizations, including: HIV awareness, PETA, CRY, and a number of environmental-awareness groups. Writing often for the The Hindustan Times, Dia has proven she has not just beauty, but brains too -- making her a very-sexy double-threat.
Malaika Arora Khan

Malaika first came on the scene as an MTV India VJ, and unsurprisingly, she garnered quite a bit of attention, and fast. Soon after she was approached for modeling and acting gigs, which is how she met her husband, the famous Bollywood actor Arbaz Khan. The rest? Beautiful, beautiful history.
Bipasha Basu

Bips, as they call her in B-Wood, is not known just for her worldclass beauty, but for her athleticism as well. Recently doing a spread for Reebok showing off her rock-hard abs, Bips also will soon be releasing her own exercise video, giving you the inside scoop on how to bring your sexy back.
Lara Dutta

The second Indian woman to win the Miss Universe Pageant, Laura is regularly considered the best contestant of all time for her heart-felt answer defending the pageant lifestyle. That same year, Priyanka Chopra and Dia Mirza won Miss World and Miss Asia Pacific titles, respectively, giving India a rare triple victory in the world of beauty pageants -- as they deserved to.
Deepika Padukone

Although Deepika has only had a handful of feature films in the last several years, and only two finding meaningful success, this stunning starlet still shows a lot of promise. As already seen, she\'s not only beautiful, but can also act and hold her own too. Now she just needs to pick better films.
Gul Panag

Gul grew up as an army brat, attending 14 schools until her family finally settled down in Punjab, India. But being well traveled isn\'t her only asset, in 1999 she not only won Miss World, but walked away with the best smile award too. She is also a Twitter-a-holic, recently even being appointed a Twitter ambassador, bringing her beauty, brains, and the occasional TwitPic, to her thousands of followers, one 140-character message at a time.
Konkona Sen

Konkona is known for her stand-out performances within India\'s excellent arthouse and indie film industry. Pairing her raw talent with her natural beauty, Konkona has found success both critically and commercially. Despite this success, she\'s never given into the pressures of the limelight, managing to keep a healthy distance from the scantily-clad trend that is currently sweeping Bollywood. Can you believe that kissing was rare on the Bollywood silver screen just a few years ago?
Priyanka Chopra

Priyanka won the Miss World title in 2000 making her the fifth Indian woman to win the crown. Following her win, she then appeared on the cover of Maxim India\'s premier issue, which caused a bit of a stir. We didn\'t mind though.
Kareena Kapoor

Kareena Kapoor comes from a family of entertainers, and as such, is no stranger to the spotlight -- but with a body like her\'s, who are we to complain? According to the young starlet,  her slender figure is all thanks to an all-vegetarian diet and a daily Yoga routine. A diet completely free of meat? Maybe not such a bad thing after all.
Katrina Kaif

Katrina, much like many of the other women in the industry, began her career in modeling, but beyond that fact, her story is a bit different. Originally modeling in London, Katrina was first discovered by a very impressed Bollywoood producer and soon after moved to Mumbai. In the beginning, film producers were hesitant to cast her as she didn\'t speak any Hindi, but that hesitation didn\'t stick long. Since 2006 Kaif has starred in several blockbusters proving that she is not only a quick learner, but a true star of the big screen as well. We agree." href="/bollywoods-hottest-leading-ladies"><span class="photo watermark"></span><img src="http://cache.static.tsavo.com/wordpress/uploads/2010/03/Aishwarya-Dhoom-sm.jpg" alt="18 of Bollywood's Hottest Leading Ladies"/></a></li><li><a rel="Girls|6 Lesser-Known Sisters Who Are Hotter Than Their Celebrity Sibling|For every Beyonce Knowles and Jessica Simpson, there is a Solange or Ashlee Simpson out there hoping to ride the coattails of her A-list sister to a little fame and fortune of her own. While most of these siblings are nothing but a reduced-quality copy of the family tree\'s favorite daughter in both talent and looks, sometimes the gene pool is deep enough to accommodate more than one Hollywood-bound family member.

For your enjoyment, here are some lesser-known sisters who are actually hotter (or at least every bit as hot) as their celebrity sibling:

Monica Cruz



Hotter than Penelope Cruz!? The hell you say! Well, one look at younger sister Monica, and it\'s clear that the Cruz family was blessed with some of the best DNA in all of Latin America. Monica Cruz has been all over Mexican television in the past few years. Look for her to cross over into English-speaking roles in the near future.

Nicky Hilton



This may just be a personal preference, but I\'d choose the classier, savvier Nicky Hilton over her slutty sister, Paris, any day of the week. Call me crazy, but there\'s just something about a girl who hasn\'t made a sex tape (purposely or not) that makes her a little more attractive in my eyes.

Jamie Lynn Spears



Once upon a time, no one could tell me that anyone, let alone some no-name sister, could be hotter than Britney Spears. A few marriages, children and emotional breakdowns later, and it\'s safe to say that Brit-Brit\'s sex-appeal has faded considerably. While Jamie Lynn already seems to be following in the foot steps of her big sis (teen pregnancy), the fact that she\'s doing so out of the limelight seems to be working in her favor.

Savannah Miller



There\'s no doubt about it, Sienna Miller is one good-looking woman. However, with her similarly striking long blonde hair (and even longer legs), Savannah Miller makes a solid case for herself. Clearly the looks of these two attractive siblings add up to one epic case of sibling rivalry.

Dedee Pfeiffer



Dedee Pfeiffer is the younger, better-aged version of Michelle Pfeiffer. Apparently, she\'s starred in a slew of films, including Wanted and Journey to the Center of the Earth (somehow I was unaware of this). She\'s also posed for Playboy, so kudos for her.

Ruby Stewart



Ruby Stewart is the half-sister of model and actress Kimberly Stewart. If you haven\'t heard of either of them, just know that they are the offspring of Rod Stewart. While her sister has struggled to grab a foothold in the world of acting, Ruby seems content in posing for lingerie ads and making the occasional cameo at one of her dad\'s concerts. I am similarly content in this career path." href="/6-lesser-known-sisters-who-are-hotter-than-their-celebrity-sibling"><span class="photo watermark"></span><img src="http://cache.static.tsavo.com/wordpress/uploads/2010/03/jamie-sm.jpg" alt="6 Lesser-Known Sisters Who Are Hotter Than Their Celebrity Sibling"/></a></li><li><a rel="Girls|Chickolith: Jessica Lowndes|

What is wrong with me? How do I not know who this beautiful, heaven-sent ray of sex is already? Something must be up with my hot-chick radar. Man, I gotta get my act together. Oh wait, no, I get it now! It\'s because she\'s from that show that I have never watched, ever, not once, not even when my girlfriend wanted to, 90210!

Yes, the heat incarnate that is Lowndes plays some dame called Adrianna on that show, and she appears to have no trouble at all taking her clothes off, which is lucky for those of you that are forced to watch the CW by the women in your life. At this point I could bore you with trivia from her IMDB page, like how she apparently uses hair extensions, or how she is an accomplished singer with four hit songs -- and how that\'s actually sort of surprising and admirable. I could tell you stuff about her, but I won\'t. Just look at her pictures. They contain all you need to know.

Meanwhile, here\'s an excerpt from a story I was just inspired to write without really knowing anything about Jessica (other than that she\'s so purty that I would sell my current gf into a lifetime of slavery just for the chance to use that $100 or so to pay for Jessica\'s dinner**).

Here goes:

Antonio Banderas and Mr. Church were relaxing in the parlor, as was their custom on a calm Sunday afternoon, smoking cigars and eating ice cream, arguing about the politics of the day. The gentlemen were joined by a mutual friend, one Miss Jessica Lowndes, whose affections both Antonio and Mr. Church were trying very hard to win. Pouring a scotch for herself, Miss Lowndes suggested a drunken contest to determine which man would escort her to the Jamboree that evening. The gentlemen agreed, quickly finished their cigars and ice cream, and set about beating the hell out of one another. Antonio, poised for victory after smashing a bottle of port on Mr. Church\'s face, suddenly suffered an aneurysm, and fell to the now-bloody parlor floor, stone dead.  Miss Lowndes helped Mr. Church bury the body under a rose bush just outside the veranda. They skipped the Jamboree, opting instead to smoke a relaxing marijuana cigarette together. Many sweaty hours later, Miss Lowndes offered Mr. Church a high-five before passing out, in ecstasy.

The End.

[gallery]

What do you get when you combine the wholesome, girl-next-door looks of Dawn Wells with the exotic, classic beauty of Sofia Loren? The answer, my friends, is Claudia Cardinale. Born in Tunisia, infused with an Italian heritage and topped off with a sultry French accent, Claudia Cardinale was one of the most stunningly eclectic beauties of the 1960s and 70s.

Though largely an international movie star, Claudia appeared in a slew of French, Italian and European films -– Cardinale also made the big skip across the pond to delight the eyes of millions of American men in such films as 8 ½ and Once Upon a Time in the West.

One look at this vintage Chickolith, and it\'s not hard to see why this former beauty queen was offered countless American movie roles, despite her near complete inability to speak English (she starred in the original Pink Panther with a dubbed over voice).

From her flowing, auburn hair and curvy physique all the way down to those long, olive-tanned legs, Claudia Cardinale offers up enough eye candy to fill Willy Wonka\'s entire factory and then some.

Check out the photos of Claudia Cardinale below. Then, watch the video below to see her get in a cat fight with the equally legendary and gorgeous Brigitte Bardot:

[gallery]
Can you spell h-a-w-t? Lady Justice is the international personification of moral force in judicial systems, but, oh, she is so much more. Her original name was Justitia, when she presided over Roman courts, making sure that justice was served. Which means she is over 2,000 years old. Guys, that\'s a woman that\'s had a lot of experience in the bedroom. She then changed her name to \Dike\ when she took over the Greek courts, party because the word \Dike\ means \Justice\ in Greek, and partly because the Greeks invented the first college system, and Lady Justice was one of the first college chicks to get dared to make out with another chick at a party. So hot.

But Lady Justice isn\'t all justice and no fun. She is also an expert swords-woman, and an incredibly precise scale-holder. When she\'s not busy holding scales incredibly accurately, or leaning on a sword, she can be seen hanging out with Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and George Clooney at the Moveon.org offices planning a moderately effective protest. Talk about well connected.

I, like so many guys, have a fetish for women who are made entirely of granite and live on the roof of the Supreme Court. In fact, my attraction to granite women who live on the roof of the Supreme Court is third only to my attraction to Asian women, and drunk girls who seem upset and keep asking you if \you really think they\'re pretty.\

With all of that combined, and her admission on Conan O\' Brian that she is, \Way into being blindfolded,\ Lady Justice is definitely one smoking hot mama, and more than earns her place in the hallowed chickolith halls." href="/chickolith-lady-justice"><span class="photo watermark"></span><img src="http://cache.static.tsavo.com/wordpress/uploads/2010/01/Justice_1_sm.jpg" alt="Chickolith - Lady Justice"/></a></li><li><a rel="Girls|Chickolith - Isla Fisher|

I\'m a sucker for pale girls. Maybe it\'s my Victorian nature, but the paler the skin, and the redder the hair, the more I\'m a sucker for a girl. Which is why Isla Fisher is probably one of the hottest women working in Hollywood at the moment.

There\'s something to be said about an attractive Australian woman. There\'s something more to be said if she\'s completed a stint in Clown College, can steal scenes left and right, and is simultaneously Australian and Scottish. You know what that means? She can probably out-drink you and then make you laugh until you pass out. Anybody who saw \Wedding Crashers\ and didn\'t walk away thinking that it was her movie was not paying attention.

In addition, she published two novels by the time she was 18. Did you hear that? She\'s a hot, funny, literate redhead. And she\'s been taken by Sacha Baron Cohen. But that doesn\'t mean we can\'t appreciate her now. Isla Fisher is so cute, in fact, kittens are planning an uprising. She\'s so hilarious, she once told a joke that summoned Don Rickles from a transcontinental dinner party. She\'s so pale, she was cast as Edward Cullen but producers kicked her out because she could act.

Let\'s look on her with the appreciation of a Victorian gentleman. Sturdy your monocles.

Murphy, 32, was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.

Here at Manolith when we\'re not trying to make you laugh, we try to bring you softcore sexy photos of girls in bikinis. Sure, you could probably find actual boobz someplace on the Internet, but we like to keep it classy. Not too classy, though, or you wouldn\'t click us up.

Gentlemen, behold. This fine specimen is Katrina Darrell, of American Idol Bikini Girl fame. Sure, the world is full of people who\'ve used American Idol to bolster their rise to Internet fame with some lame gimmick, but this girl actually has a really kick-ass gimmick. And she just released her exclusive Christmas photos and MP3\'s on Myspace.

Anyone who saw her episode remembers how she took a while to win over the girls, but Randy and Simon gave her a yes vote right away. And if this girl came in to your office for an audition, wouldn\'t you give her a yes vote, especially if she sang  \Vision of Love\ by Mariah Carry?

Breaking news: a Hollywood starlet has beaten back the aging demons us common folk succumb to all too often. Also, the sky is blue, Dave Eggers is a good writer, and the pope shits in the woods. Wait. I did that last one wrong.

Sharon Stone. She\'s an actress known and beloved to the world by being in a few groundbreaking movies and a few really bad ones, but all the while being a tall statuesque Aryan wet dream. And these days, she\'s making waves by posing all sexy-like on the cover of a French magazine.

One thing you may notice about Sharon Stone is that she\'s 90% legs. A house could be built on her foundation, and would not go wanting. If cannibals ever caught her and tried to eat her, her legs would feed a village long enough for them to evolve and take over the civilized world. She\'s like a midget on stilts. Rumor has it she was created by John Hammond when he combined the DNA of a giraffe and Nico. If you ever want to watch the most sexually charged, awkward interview in history, watch Jon Stewart\'s interview with her on \The Daily Show.\

And if you think she\'s limited as an actress, watch \Casino.\ She plays a crazy woman who takes over a man\'s life. Then watch \Basic Instinct,\ where she...never mind. Let\'s just look at those goddamn legs.

And she\'s said some weird things before in the past, but she\'s hot and most likely crazy. So we let them slide a little.

Plus, look at those goddamn legs.

I\'m thinking that if you\'re straight, male, and looking at this article at all, the chances that you read anything past the title are pretty damn slim, as there probably is not enough blood left in your brain to sustain literacy.

However, if you have gotten this far into the text, then surely, you are either not attracted to women, or some form of literate non-human entity that I have yet to encounter. Possibly you are some form of vegetable that gained sentience, or Lieutenant Commander Data from Star Trek.

I have so many questions for those of you who fall into this category. Mainly, what\'s it like to look at Marisa Miller and have no sexual feelings at all? What, for fuck\'s sake? I am seriously, earnestly asking, because it simply does not compute in my non-robotic, non-vegetable mind. Her body is literally perfect. And it\'s not just that; the shape of her mouth is so damn sexy, especially in that teasing half-smile found in so many of her photos.

To me, the notion of not being turned on by her is kind of a newer, better version of the old Zen meditative riddle about a tree: If you met Marisa Miller and she failed to give you wood and no one was around, would you make a sound? I don\'t think that would be possible for me, but if I did happen to encounter her, I know that I would try my best to get a solid mental picture, then find a private place and make the sound of one hand clapping.

Remember last week when photos from that sexy Mormon baking calendar thing leaked? Well, today even more photos have made their way into the world of Internet-land. But for those not yet up-to-date, here\'s the story in short.

A few years back, an entrepreneurial dude named Chad Hardy had a great idea, he would make a calendar featuring sexy Mormons to, you know, let the world know that such things existed. His first project was \Men on a Mission,\ a calender chock-full of sexy young Mormon men. This calendar was a huge success for Hardy, and women the world over loved the idea, however, unfortunately, the Mormon Church was not as excited. In fact, in response they excommunicated Mr. Hardy. Harsh.

Win a Mormon Muffin T Shirt!

Not one to give up though -- as I said, quite the entrepreneur -- Hardy has decided to double down on his effort, this time around with a calendar featuring sexy Mormon women,  which he has titled \Hot Mormon Muffins.\ And to make the double entendre all the more fun, he included 12 delicious muffin recipes to go along with all 12 delicious uhh, muffins women. Anyway, some of the photos from this new calendar leaked last week (as mentioned above) and you can check them out here, as for the new ones, check below!

Click on the images to reveal the answers!

1. This celeb has an eclectic mix of tats, this one\'s a quote from Shakespeare\'s \King Lear\.



2. Let\'s just say I wont be surprised when this celeb end up in the \Guinness Book of World Records\ for breaking some sort of tattoo related record! Here\'s what they have to say about why they have so many, \I tattooed my body so I couldn\'t fall back on anything. I purposely did that so I couldn\'t get a normal job and live a normal life. I did it so I had to play music.\



3. This cute ankle tattoo has inspired young girls across the nation to make rosaries a permanent accessory to their wardrobes, this celeb was said to have gotten it to reaffirm her faith.



4. This big cross tat was actually to cover up another. It originally read, \carpe diem...with my girl,\ the words \Carpe Diem\ (Latin for \seize the day\). After they were divorced \with my girl\ was covered by a cross.



5. This celeb is rumored to have eleven strategically placed tattoos... this is probably one of the most visible.



6. This celebrity is said to have gotten his first tattoo when he was only 13!



7. \Vivere senza rimipianti,\ which means, \to live without regrets\ in Italian. Unfortunately, for this celeb, the tattoo reads \rimipianti\ instead of \rimpianti,\ adding an extra \i\. I wonder if there are any regrets after all?



8. This sports bad boy was one of the first to sport tattoos on the court... loud and proud!



9. This celeb has the Sanskrit character of a lotus tattooed on the wrist. It\'s so tiny most people don\'t even know it\'s there.



10. This tat is said to symbolize the loss of three family members.

The season where girls have a blank check to dress as slutty as they like without any fear of judgment...and guys, well, guys have a blank check to look at girls dressed as slutty as they like.

None of this is new news of course -- young costumers have been capitalizing on this salacious opportunity for years, and costume companies have been capitalizing on young costumers for just as long. But with any expanding market, it was only a matter of time before somebody went too far. Sexy Nurse, Sexy Cowgirl, Sexy Little Bo Peep, sure. But Sexy Chain-Gang Member? Here are twelve of this year\'s costume companies\' that attempted to just slap the word \sexy\ onto any noun, and sell it to you for $39.95.
Sexy SpongeBob

Of all the cartoon characters to make sexy, I have to say SpongeBob is not at the top of my list. He\'s yellow. He\'s a rectangular prism. He\'s a dude. Not to mention that 99% of his fans are under the age of eight (the other 1% are creepy older dudes who, I admit, would probably love this costume). If you\'re a girl trying to get attention this Halloween, cartoons can work, but think Jessica Rabbit. Think Daphne from \Scooby Doo\. Stay away from Nickelodeon.
Sexy Barbarian

The first rule of sexy Halloween costumes is, \Show some skin.\ The second rule is, \Don\'t carry a weapon so huge that guys will pay more attention to it than to you.\ The third rule is, \Don\'t wear pink poofy fur balls unless you\'re going as a Poodle, a Dr. Seuss character, or Cotton Candy\ (now there\'s an idea for a weird sexy Halloween costume). This costume shatters all the rules, and, furthermore, is an insult to sexy costumes everywhere, to this cute girl\'s potential, and I\'m pretty sure to barbarians too.
Sexy Bubble Wrap

This costume is awesome, if a tiny triangle of bubble wrap over each of your privates can be considered a costume. It\'s more of a, \Hey, look at my boobs and crotch!\ announcement that invites a type of sexual assault that, I\'m pretty sure, would be quite defensible in most courts.
Sexy C3PO

This picture is not sexy. This costume is not sexy. There is one sexy costume opportunity in Star Wars. The annoying golden robot guy is not it.
Sexy Chicken Choker

WFT? No seriously, WTF. This is advertised as, \Sexy Chicken Restaurant Worker\, which is strange enough in itself, but then they had to go and add the rubber chicken. OK, nice accessory and double-entendre, but I don\'t think that\'s how chicken restaurants work. I\'m not sure what\'s more of a stretch, their attempt to make a costume out of this, or that chick\'s shirt.
Sexy Clown Fish

(image courtesy of yandy.com)
Sexy Mermaid is one thing, but they\'re really going for it with this one. Yes, this girl would look pretty good in anything, but I think part of the \Sexy Object\ formula, is an assumption that Object is human, or at least a mammal (see: \Sexy Aardvark\). Frankly speaking, there just aren\'t that many \sexy\ creatures in the sea, and the Clown Fish is probably one of the most obscure of all. Sure, the Clown Fish is colorful, but colorful is not sexy. In fact in this case, it\'s just plain weird.
Sexy Life-Size Doll

OK, I get it. Sort of like Barbie. Except for that Barbie in real life would be hot, whereas Barbie in a box is, you know, plastic. Maybe this hits a little too close to \dead girl in a display case\ to be sexy for me. Not to mention it\'s got to be about the most cumbersome costume since the Kool-Aid Guy.
Sexy Earth

Nothing is sexier than Mother Earth! Unless of course you\'re not a tree-hugging vegan hippie. In that case this costume is just gaudy and round. But hey, maybe this person is only going for tree-hugging hippies, in which case she\'s on the right track to finding one to locate in  one of her lovely, topographic canyons and stick something where ... Alright, enough.
Sexy Marie Antoinette

Look, I\'m sure Marie Antoinette was sexy. But is a costume of an esoteric historical heroine really a good idea? (Especially one with a Sheltie on her head?) After all, Leg Avenue is still reeling from the bombs that were the Sexy Joan of Arc and Sexy Mary Magdalene costumes.
Sexy Nun

Because nothing\'s sexier than a nun. Except, you know, maybe someone that would theoretically have sex with you.
Sexy Plus-Size Referee

Sexy Referee was bad enough (does that costume make sense to anyone? Anyone?) But I suppose ladies of all sizes deserve an excuse to display their womanly parts in a ridiculous outfit that speaks more of \zebra\ than \sports official\.
Sexy, uh, Tuxedo

And, at last, we have what\'s billed as \Sexy Tuxedo\. Because I think if you look close, there\'s a tiny bowtie or something right above that girl\'s hoo-hah. And this really sums up our list, and the reason we all like Halloween in the first place: it doesn\'t matter if your costume is really a costume, or in this case even qualifies as \clothes\ ... as long as you\'re willing to get drunk and show your nether regions to lots and lots (and I mean lots) of strangers.
