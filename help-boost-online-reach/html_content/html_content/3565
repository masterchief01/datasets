<p>I have been making granola nearly every week, since my husband loves it and it makes great gifts for friends and family. But I've been slightly perplexed, until now, as to how to get the granola to clump up. I love chunky, clumpy sheets of granola that hold together until you chop them up. I finally found two significant elements, however, that will help you get deliciously clustered granola!</p><h3>What You Need</h3>

<p><b>Ingredients</b><br/>1 batch <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/recipe-review/watch-out-dangerously-addictive-olive-oil-granola-recipe-review-092132">homemade granola</a>, not yet baked<br/>1 egg white</p>

<p><b>Equipment</b><br/>Large baking pan, <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/tip-bake-granola-on-parchment-for-easy-transfer-108974">lined with baking parchment</a><br/>Small bowl or ramekin<br/>Whisk</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p><b>1.</b> Mix your batch of granola. (We really like <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/recipe-review/watch-out-dangerously-addictive-olive-oil-granola-recipe-review-092132">this recipe</a>!)</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Whisk an egg white in a small cup until it is frothy and foamy.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Stir the egg white into the granola. Spread the granola out in an even layer on your prepared baking sheet, and bake the granola according to the instructions in your recipe.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Take the granola out of the oven and let it cool COMPLETELY, preferably overnight, uncovered. When it cools completely it will be clumpy. If you pour it off the baking sheet while still hot it will break up into loose granola and not get the chance to clump up.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> When the granola is completely cool, break up into clumpy chunks, and transfer to an airtight container for storage.</p>

<p><b>Additional Notes:</b></p>

<p>&bull; The granola in the photos is from Melissa Clark's recipe for <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/recipe-review/watch-out-dangerously-addictive-olive-oil-granola-recipe-review-092132">Olive Oil Granola</a>.</p>

      <p class="text">Wondering if it would be okay to add the fruit after it's baked (mixed in while still hot, but then left alone overnight).  I just think baking the dried fruit with the rest of the granola makes for some too-chewy/very hard dried fruit!</p>

      <p class="text">Is the egg white binding shelf stable?  Is there a potential for food poisoning if the granola is left out of the refrigerator?  I'm not sure about the idea from a safety issue.  Splatgirl is correct...applesauce or fruit purees will clump up the granola very well and not carry potential food poisoning issues.</p>

      <p class="text">The last time I made the NYTimes recipe I used some water to break up a boulder of brown sugar that had formed in the bag. An unplanned side effect of the extra liquid seems to be much chunkier granola! I'm going to try using a sugar syrup again next time to see if I get the same pleasant results.</p>

      <p class="text">What I do is divide the finished, cooked tray in half.  Scoop half into a giant bowl to cool and leave the other half pressed in the tray.  When it cools, the tray half is stuck together and then I break it up into smaller chunks.  (FYI, I use the NYT recipe )</p>

      <p class="text">An egg-free way to make your homemade granola clumpy:<br>Before you add the wet ingredients to your granola, put about half of the dry ingredients into a food processor and pulse it until it is the consistency of bread crumbs, then combine it back with the unprocessed dry ingredients and continue the recipe. I like to bake it on a cookie sheet with a lip, pressing the granola down and compacting it as much as possible.</p>

      <p class="text">Another egg-free option:<br><br>I found that adding a little flour and baking my granola at LOW heat makes it chunky.

      <p class="text">I make granola bars quite often and the 'glue' is natural peanut butter (I just make my own by running unsalted roasted peanuts in my mini food processor until they form a paste), honey, brown sugar and a little water. It works very well once you get the process down.</p>

      <p class="text">This is an awesome idea.. I also had been doing the flour-water method (also using the yummy supper recipe as a guideline) but I'm excited to try the egg white method too.<br><br>As far as the potential food poisoning issue... agreed that as long as it's fully cooked it should be shelf-stable for at least a few days or whatever, but if you make larger batches of granola (as I do) I might worry?  Because I'm crazy and/or paranoid?  In any case, I remember reading somewhere that storing granola in the freezer was the best way to make it stay crunchy as long as possible, so that's where I've always kept mine.  Cooked egg whites in there with the oats etc. should be fine, too.</p>

      <p class="text">A gluten-free, vegan alternative to the egg white is <b>ground, untoasted flax seed</b>.  Grind 1 T flax seeds in a coffee grinder, then blend with 3 T water.  You must blend, not whisk, in order for the flax to gel and provide binding characteristics similar to egg.  This substitution works well in baked goods, though I have not tried it in this granola recipe yet.<br><br>Another choice is <b>rice flour</b>, which is easily found in Asian grocery stores.  Try adding 1 T rice flour with the rest of your dry ingredients, then press the granola into the pan and bake as directed in the recipe.  Hope this helps!</p>

      <p class="text">I've had a similar scenario while loving to make and eat granola, never knew the trick to getting it to have the chunky clusters of oats. I made a batch this morning, and voila! Big oat and cinnamon sugar clusters in every bite. What worked for me was to add 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour to the dry ingredients, my recipe instructs to bake for 30 minutes at 300 degrees, stirring every 10 minutes. The other trick was to very gently stir, with a spoon, as not to break up the oats like you would with a fork. I only stir it the first after 10 and 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes let it cool completely, and break up the bigger chunks with a spoon. No more high priced gourmet granola for me, now that I know the secret to great granola!</p>

      <p class="text">I tried this recipe for chunky granola<br>http://thyme2cook.blogspot.com/2007/01/big-chunky-granola.html<br>The first time it was overdone and not chunky.  Put the fruit in too early, too, which made it way too chewy, if chewy is even the word. A few days ago I tried it again, READ the recipe more carefully this time and tried turning the temp down on my oven - it came out a little underdone and still not chunky.  Fruit was a lot better. I then tried your egg-white technique, rebaking my underdone granola in smaller batches and its just right!  THANK YOU for the tip.</p>

      <p class="text">Like everyone here, I've been striving to get my granola to clump for years.  I finally figured out what Faith mentioned: that you HAVE to let the granola cool completely before you break it up.  This is key.  However, I've had great success without using an egg white, flour, or any other ground addition.  It's not too sweet and has the perfect crunch.  I baked it on parchment paper for about an hour, or until it's really browned (almost just before it burns, so you have to keep a close eye) at 150C/300F.  I used: 4.5 cups rolled oats, 1/3 c honey, 1/6 cup molasses, 1/6 cup maple syrup, 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup walnut oil, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 cup slivered almonds, 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds.  To make it vegans, sub the honey with agave nectar.  Thanks Faith, I'm glad to know that the cooling really is key and that my granola isn't just a fluke.  Happy baking!</p>

      <p class="text">Here's how I do it: I make a normal batch (I never use egg whites), then after taking it out of the oven I take another baking sheet and put that directly on top of the cooling granola batch. I usually weigh it down with a couple of cast iron pans. The pressure helps it stick together. Then when it's cool, I break it apart! Easy peasy!</p>

However, I've had great success without using an egg white, flour, or any other ground addition.  It's not too sweet and has the perfect crunch.  I baked it on parchment paper for about an hour, or until it's really browned (almost just before it burns, so you have to keep a close eye) at 150C/300F.  I used: 4.5 cups rolled oats, 1/3 c honey, 1/6 cup molasses, 1/6 cup maple syrup, 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup walnut oil, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 cup slivered almonds, 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds.  To make it vegans, sub the honey with agave nectar.  Thanks Faith, I'm glad to know that the cooling really is key and that my granola isn't just a fluke.
