<span class="swp-breadcrumbs-level"> <span class="delim">&gt;&gt;</span> <strong>Free Picks</strong></span></div><h1><strong style="color: #008000; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;">Free Sports Betting Picks</strong></h1><p style="text-align: left;"><em>Our free sports picks are now 254-161-2 all-time, TY Phillies, Passed on Sun., TY Pirates/Cards on Sat., TY Mariners on Fri.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Free MLB Release For 8/21:</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Los Angeles Angels (+100 @ <a href="http://www.iseewinners.com/bovada/" target="_blank">Bovada Sportsbook</a>) are showing solid value, and should not be listed as a dog in tonight's match-up with the Red Sox. The Angels will go with Ervin Santana in tonight's opener. Santana's numbers on the road this year have been atrocious to say the least. He got hit hard up until around the All-Star break. But Santana has quietly put together four decent starts in a row entering tonight's game. And he's a perfect 4-0 against the moneyline in those four outings. In fact, Santana has posted a decent 3.26 ERA and a dominating 0.88 WHIP in his last three starts. He shouldn't have too many troubles keeping this depleted Boston line-up in check tonight at Fenway Park. Santana's actually enjoyed much success in this park over recent years, going 4-1 against the moneyline in his last five visits. He's facing a Red Sox lineup that's batted just .229 while averaging 3.56 Runs/Game against right-handed pitchers in their last five games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Aaron Cook will be on the bump for the home team. Cook is 3-6 with a 4.58 ERA overall. But he enters tonight in horrible K/BB form, with just 5 punchouts to 8 walks in his last five starts. The Boston Red Sox are just 1-4 in those five outings. Cook has also enjoyed some success against his opponent tonight. But that success came when he was still with the Rockies, on a much better Colorado team at that. We suspect that Cook is going to have his hands full with the Angels tonight. In their last five games, Los Angeles is batting .351 while averaging 6.75 Runs/Game against right-handed pitching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LA is 7-0 in their last 7 road games vs. a team with a losing record. The Angels are also 4-1 in their last five games following a day off. Boston is 2-6 in their last 8 games against a team with a winning record. The Red Sox are also just 2-7 in their last 9 games following a day off. Look for LA to bounce back from that poor performance with a white-hot Rays team. We'll take the Angels to win tonight's opener in Boston.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #ffcc00;">Free MLB Release For 8/20:</strong><span style="color: #ffcc00;"> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We're backing the Philadelphia Phillies behind Roy Halladay (-143 @ <a href="http://www.iseewinners.com/justbet/" target="_blank">Justbet</a>) tonight against the Cincinnati Reds. Since this is our highest priced play on our card, it gets the call as the free pick. Halladay has finally returned true to form here in the dog days of the summer. After a rough stretch in July when he returned from the d/l, Halladay's now posted a solid 1.64 ERA and an outstanding 0.59 WHIP through 3 starts in August. Halladay enters tonight's matchup in excellent K/BB form, striking out 27 batters in his last 4 outings while walking just 3. He's also had plenty of success against the Reds in his career, going 4-0 against the moneyline in his last four starts against them. We're expecting more of the same tonight. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mike Leake will be toeing the rubber for the visitors in tonight's matchup. Leake checks in with a 4.29 ERA overall in 2012 and a decent 1.28 WHIP. Unlike Halladay however, Leake has not fared well against his opponent tonight. In fact Leake is 0-3 against the moneyline in his three career starts against the Phillies, allowing 15 earned runs in just 20 1/3 innings of work. Grant it, this isn't the same Philadelphia line-up as in recent years. But with Halladay throwing as well as he is, we probably won't need too many runs to cash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Phillies have won 9 of their last 13 games at Citizens Bank Park. Philadelphia is also 7-1 at the window in their last 8 when listed as a small home favorite (-110 to -150). Cincinnati is 12-4 in their last 16 on the road, mostly beating the teams they're supposed to beat. But note that the Reds are just 2-6 in their last 8 games listed as a road dog. Cincinnati is also just 7-20 in their last 27 games in Philadelphia. We'll lay the price on the Phillies as a small home favorite tonight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong><br /></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>8/19/2012: </strong></span><span style="color: #888888;">We are passing on a free play for Sunday. Back on Monday.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Free MLB Release For 8/18:</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The over is showing us some positive value at Busch Stadium this afternoon (Over 8 Runs, -105 @ <a href="http://www.iseewinners.com/5dimes/" target="_blank">5dimes</a>). Lance Lynn will be on the bump for the Cardinals in this one. Lynn has had a solid 2012 campaign overall. But he's been fading down the stretch, allowing 16 earned runs in his last four outings and rarely lasting more than 5 innings. This will be the fourth time the Pirates line-up has seen his stuff this year so they will be familiar with his style. Lynn won his first two starts against the Bucs. But he dropped the 3rd start, which was also at Busch Stadium, surrendering 6 earned runs in just 5 innings. Lynn is facing a Pirates line-up today that has been hot against right-handed pitching, averaging 5.32 Runs per 9 innings in their last ten games. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Erik Bedard will be toeing the rubber for the visitors. Bedard checks in with a 4.56 ERA and a 1.42 WHIP overall in 2012. But most of his success has come at home. On the road, the southpaw owns a terrible 6.75 ERA and a 1.76 WHIP. Despite his one quality start against the Diamondbacks, Bedard has still posted a 6.06 ERA in his last 3 outings. He's had two starts at Busch Stadium already this year and both went over today's posted total. Bedard will be facing a Cardinals line-up that bats .306 and averages 6.34 Runs per 9 Innings against left-handed pitching at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The over is 5-1-1 in the last 7 meetings between these clubs, and 6-1-1 in the last 8 times they played at Busch Stadium. The over is 2-1 in Lynns 3 starts against Pittsburgh this year, both overs being in St Louis. And the over is a solid 4-1-1 in Erik Bedards last 6 starts against a team with a winning record. We're expecting enough runs to cover the total in St Louis today.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><br /></em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Free MLB Release For 8/17:</strong></span> </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We're backing the Seattle Mariners (-128 @ <a href="http://www.iseewinners.com/5dimes/" target="_blank">5dimes</a>) against the Minnesota Twins tonight. Seattle will go with their right-hander, Hisashi Iwakuma. Iwakuma is no ace by any stretch of the imagination. But he has held opposing line-ups to 3 runs or less in his last 5 outings. Iwakamu also owns a solid 2.97 ERA and a 1.22 WHIP at Safeco Field. That's much better than what we can expect from Nick Blackburn, who will be toeing the rubber for the visitors. Blackburn owns one of the worst road ERAs in the bigs at 7.98 Runs/9 Innings. That number goes with a horrible 1.73 Road WHIP in 2012 as well. Minnesota has never seen Iwakuma in action and that always gives a little bit of an advantage to the pitcher. Blackburn is just 1-3 against the moneyline in his last 4 starts in Seattle. The Twins are just 1-5 in their last 6 against a right-handed starter, and they're 1-4 in their last five after having a day off. Seattle is 9-1 in their last 10 home games, including a perfect 7-0 when listed as home chalk. We'll play the Mariners in the opening game of this series at Safeco Field tonight.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Sign Up Here To Receive Our Free Sports Picks Via Email:</span></h2>	<div id="blockStyle2494Main429" class=" ccm-block-styles" >
