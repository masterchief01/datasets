      to explain the main reason for which healthy people may not be getting refreshing sleep: <b>sleep

<p>The cycle of sleep and waking is regulated by the body clock. Body clock is
located in the brain (<i>suprachiasmatic nucleus</i>). The clock has a period of
about 24 hours. During a single 24 hour day we have a period of 6-10 hours
when we are very sleepy. This is the time when we normally sleep. During the
remaining 14-18 hours we are usually awake; however, only a portion of that waking time is suitable for intellectual effort. This period of maximum
alertness may last as little as 2-6 hours. We should plan our day in such a way
that sleep comes at the time of maximum sleepiness, while activities that demand maximum
focus or creativity fall into the hours of maximum alertness. It is very
difficult and usually very unhealthy to force your body and your body clock to do what
you wish. It
is far easier to do the opposite: adapt your life to your body clock. This article is
intended to help you understand your body clock. </p>

<p><b>Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome</b></p>

<p>Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) is a sleep disorder in which an
individual finds it difficult to fall asleep late in the night, and sleeps
well into the afternoon if not awakened. DSPS has only been characterized in
1982, but increasing data indicates that various degrees of DSPS occur with
epidemic frequency, esp. among high school and university students. DSPS
individuals often like to keep on learning late into the night, go to sleep very
late (for example, 4-6 am), and find it very hard to wake up early on a regular basis.
For example, regular getting up at 7 am is a pure torture for individuals affected
with DSPS. They often fail to keep jobs that require them to perform early in
the morning. Very often, they tend to split the day sleep into two components.
For example, DSPS students often get a short sleep in the night, wake up early with an alarm clock, go
to school where they are semi-conscious and perform poorly, get a solid nap
after school and only late in the evening they regain vigor and their full mental
powers. DSPS students feel best
after midnight when everyone else is asleep and they can focus on learning or
other activities (reading, Internet, watching TV, computer games, etc.).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main factors contributing to DSPS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increased period of the body clock (well above 25 hours)</li>
  <li>reduced or increased sensitivity to factors that reset or advance body clock (e.g. light,
    activity, stress, etc.)</li>
  <li>electric lighting, 24-hour economy and the resulting &quot;want to do
    more&quot; lifestyle</li>
</ul>

<p>A normal individual has a body clock running with a period slightly longer
than 24 hours. The clock is reset in the morning with activity and bright light.
Thus a normal individual easily adjusts to the standard day-night cycle.
However, DSPS individuals may have their clocks running periods long enough to
find it hard to fit to 24 hours. They also push their clocks ahead by activity
late in the evening (the process opposite to the morning reset synchronization).
DSPS individuals, when given a chance to sleep
when they want, will tend to go to sleep later and later. They will also wake up
later and later. DSPS people do not have problems with sleep if they sleep in
their favorite hours.&nbsp;Most mild DSPS cases can be remedied by changes in
lifestyle, but rarely are those changes painless to individuals affected with
the condition.</p>

<p>If this description fits your problem, you may diagnose the degree of your
DSPS with <i>SleepChart </i>freeware at the bottom of this article.</p>

<p><b>Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome</b></p>

<p>Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS) is the opposite of DSPS. People suffering
from ASPS get very sleepy early in the evening and wake up very early in the
night. They circadian clock runs at less than 24 hour period. As they constantly
struggle to survive to a reasonable evening hour, they sleep less, awake early
and experience increased tiredness during the day. While a typical DSPS person is
an adolescent student, a typical ASPS person is a retiree or a middle age low
stress tolerance woman. The link between the age and sleep phase disorders may
be related to aging itself; however, it may also be a result of lifestyle
changes that come with age.</p>

<p><b>Correlates of sleep phase syndromes</b></p>

<p> DSPS is more
prevalent among adolescents, while ASPS is more frequently observed in aging
population. DSPS is also by
far more frequent among students, programmers, avid readers, passionate artists,
computer game addicts, etc. ASPS seems
more likely in individuals whose life is deprived of intense stimulation (esp.
in the evening), who
meet fewer new challenges, or who are not facing information overload, stress, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Finally, there is a complex relationship between DSPS/ASPS and
depression/mania. On one hand, there may be a link between DSPS and manic personalities.
Anti-depressants tend to increase the period of the body clock (e.g. clorgyline, imipramine).
On the other, paradoxically, DSPS individuals may be more likely to suffer from depression
(e.g. when in conditions of insomnia, sleep deprivation, resulting social
problems, etc.). Similarly, low-stress tolerance depressed
individuals are, more likely to suffer from ASPS. Again, when they
are forced to adapt to &quot;normal&quot; life, their symptoms of depression
tend to weaken as sleep deprivation here counteracts depression.&nbsp;The
cause-effect relationship between sleep phase disorders and mood disorders is
complex. Understanding it will contribute substantially to solving the
escalating epidemic of sleep phase disorders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not known which are the predominant underlying physiological factors
that result in sleep phase disorders. Family clusters show that genes may affect
the length of the circadian period. The lifestyle may affect levels of
neurotransmitters and these could affect the period of the circadian clock.
Conversely, the level of neurotransmitters may select for a specific lifestyle
choices. Age may have a direct impact on the clock circuits, it may affect
neurotransmitters or it can affect the lifestyle.&nbsp;Last but not least, sleep
phase disorders will affect the mood and the levels of neurotransmitters in
varying ways depending on whether free running sleep is used to remedy the disorder or
wherever the individual attempts to fit a predetermined desirable sleep schedule.</p>

<p><b>How body regulates sleepiness</b></p>

<p>There are two main mechanisms that regulate sleepiness. One is the body clock
and the other is the &quot;wake-meter&quot;. Body clock produces increased sleepiness every
24 hours. The wake-meter increases sleepiness with prolonged wakefulness (i.e.
the longer we do not sleep, the sleepier we are). In sleep literature, these two
mechanisms are called the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep.</p>

<p>Sleep control components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>circadian clock </b>- circadian clock produces sleepiness in 24 hour
    cycles&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>homeostatic control </b>- wake-meter measures the period in which we
    stay awake and triggers sleepiness after we stay up for long enough</li>
</ul>
<p>In DSPS or ASPS people, there may exist a combination of several factors that
make it harder to get good sleep:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Circadian clock runs in periods far different from 24 hours. In DSPS
    people, the circadian clock may be set to 25-26 hours. In ASPS people, it
    could be 23 hours</li>
  <li>Circadian clock is not sensitive to time resetting factors (professionally
    termed <i>zeitgebers</i>). Normal people reset their clock in the morning by light and
    activity. In addition, darkness and inactivity in the evening provide
    further clues for the clock. Normal people with normal lifestyles can easily
    synchronize their sleep with the day-night cycle</li>
  <li>Homeostatic wake-meter shows changed sensitivity. Sensitive wake-meter
    will make people get tired very quickly after awakening. Insensitive
    wake-meter may make people tend to stay up for long</li>
  <li>Lifestyle has a dramatic effect on the behavior of the circadian and
    homeostatic sleep regulation mechanisms. The same individual will show
    different sleep rhythm depending on such factors as: using artificial
    lighting, exercise, level of stress, timing of exciting activities, napping,
    diet, climate, changes in ambient temperature, health status, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Examples of different sleeping rhythms</b></p>
<p>Freeware <i>SleepChart </i>application that comes with this article (bottom) makes it possible to take
a snapshot of sleep that graphically illustrates DSPS and ASPS rhythms.</p>
<p><b>24 hour cycle. </b>Let us first consider an ideally synchronized 24-hour
cycle. In the picture below, an octogenarian female wakes up naturally everyday
around 3:00-3:30 am. She sleeps 5.4-5.5 hours per day, wakes up refreshed and is
active throughout the day. There is no synchronization with daylight as the
waking hour falls into the period of darkness. The cycle is synchronized by
evening activities. The subjects keeps in her mind a &quot;must go to sleep&quot; hour estimation
that
helps synchronize body clock with the time of day. This &quot;psychological
imprint&quot; is illustrated by a smooth change in the sleeping rhythm after the
end of the daylight saving time on Sunday October 27, 2002 (the graph disregards
DST so that the waking hour before the change is set at 2:00-2:30 am).</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="sleeper/antosia.gif" width="670" height="610"></p>
<p><b>24 hour cycle and stress. </b>Let us now consider the impact of stress on
a well-synchronized sleeping rhythm. In the picture below, a middle-aged
self-employed male wakes up naturally everyday
around 6:00-6:20. However, on June 3, 2003, a severe family problem throws the
rhythm into chaos as evidenced by frequent nocturnal awakenings. The rhythm
returned to norm one month later as soon as the family conflict was resolved.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="sleeper/conflict.gif" width="824" height="449"></p>
<p><b>Asynchronous DSPS</b>.<b> </b>People suffering from DSPS find it difficult
to synchronize with 24-hour clock. In the picture below, adolescent female with
a mild DSPS suffers disintegration of the sleeping rhythm due to the failed efforts
to synchronize with &quot;civilized&quot; life. After the vacation period, she
begins in early September well-synchronized with the &quot;rest of the
world&quot;. She wakes up between 6:30 and 10:00. However, her body clock
experiences continuous shift of optimum sleeping hours. Soon she wakes up at
12:00 and begins a struggle against the further shift. This results in
disintegration of the sleep cycle, short sleep periods (e.g. 4 hours) and
frequent bouts of tiredness. The presented software attempts to plot the hours
of maximum natural sleepiness (between red and brown lines). Clearly, the
greatest disturbance in sleep occurs at the point where the &quot;natural&quot;
rhythm departs furthest from the &quot;desired&quot; rhythm. Mild DSPS cases are
able to force the body clock to remain more or less in the desired bounds at the
cost of constant struggle with sleepiness. In more severe cases, the circadian
variables will run a 24 hour cycle and the individual will experience return to
&quot;good sleep&quot; when free running variables align again with the
&quot;desired&quot; sleep period. In the graph below, October 7 sleep period is almost
aligning with the hours of maximum sleepiness resulting in good long refreshing
sleep. The average sleep length is 6.8
hours but it changes widely. The average DSPS shift is difficult to determine
due to the &quot;struggle&quot; with the natural rhythm; however, if is likely
to be above 60 minutes as evidenced at the beginning of the graph.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="sleeper/runner.gif" width="716" height="585"></p>
<p><b>Synchronous DSPS</b>. A graph below presents a sleep rhythm of a
middle-aged self-employed male. A very clear and regular DSPS
pattern visible in the graph with a daily phase shift of 64-68 minutes. Although sleeping in &quot;unnatural&quot; hours
is certainly less beneficial healthwise than normal sleep, for a DSPS patient,
free running sleep rhythm may by far less stressful and disruptive than any
attempt to fit to &quot;standard&quot; lifestyle (as shown above). There have
been cases in literature that documented people living along such shifting DSPS schedule for
decades without major health side effects although some authors claim increased
incidence of depression, alcoholism or dependence on sedatives (as a result of
attempts to induce sleep). A very reliable determinant of
synchronous DSPS is the disruption of the link between the sleep onset hour and
sleep duration. As the duration of sleep is determined by the circadian phase,
well-synchronized sleep schedule shows little variability in the sleep length
(6.6 hours in the graph below).
In particular, the sleep length is independent of the sleep onset hour. Wherever the patient makes any attempt to
synchronize with daylight or daylight-related activities, the link between sleep
length and the onset hour will be reconstituted. Mistakenly, DSPS people are
often called &quot;owls&quot; for their tendency to stay up late, while ASPS
people are called &quot;larks&quot;. The graph below illustrates why this is a
misnomer.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="sleeper/dsps.gif" width="688" height="569"></p>

<p><b>SleepChart: A sleep charting and scheduling application</b></p>

<p>You can download a freeware <i>SleepChart </i>application by clicking the link
at the bottom of the article.</p>

<p>All you need to do in the program is to click the beginning and the end of the sleep block
in the graph. See the bottom of the display for exact hour points corresponding
to the position of the mouse pointer. If you set a wrong block, select it by
clicking and press <i>Del</i>.</p>
<p><i>SleepChart</i> will attempt to approximate the circadian low that correlates
with high sleepiness, low temperature, low ACTH, high melatonin, etc. The
underlying assumption is that you do not attempt to regulate your sleep. This
means that you do not wake up with an alarm clock or do not struggle against the
sleepiness in the evening (e.g. in order to delay sleep). Currently there is no
option that would let you eliminate artificially-regulated sleep blocks. This
means that all attempts to modify your sleep schedule will fool the algorithm
and your reading will be inaccurate or plain wrong. It is also very important
that you do not attempt to follow the circadian approximation when determining
your optimum sleep hours! This can result in a positive feedback of error and
disintegration of the sleep cycle. In other words, errors in the graph may be
amplified by your attempts to follow the graph. At worst, you could even
self-diagnose yourself with DSPS without actually suffering from the disorder! Your
only and sole &quot;go to
sleep&quot; criterion should be rapidly increasing sleepiness. You may use the graph to
approximate the moment in which the readiness for sleep will occur. You can also find it helpful in
chronotherapy for ASPS or DSPS to make it easier to schedule your appointments
without conflicting with your natural sleep rhythm.</p>

<p><b>Circadian graph in DSPS</b></p>

<p>The circadian graph can help you better understand your sleep rhythm with its
homeostatic and circadian components. You will need a few months of data before
the graph becomes meaningful. In addition, sleep boundary approximation lines
are subject to substantial hysteresis. If your lifestyle changes dramatically
(e.g. as a result of therapy), you may need a few weeks for the approximation
lines to align properly with data. The circadian graph may then be more
difficult to interpret. Having separate data sets for such circumstances solves
the problem.</p>

<p><b>
Homeostatic: </b>The blue
line corresponds with homeostatic sleepiness derived from the number of sleep
blocks falling into a given hour of the waking day (i.e. where zero refers to
the hour of waking). It roughly expresses your
&quot;tiredness of wakefulness&quot;. It also expresses your ability to fall
asleep. From the graph below you can read that the best chances of falling
asleep fall around 18th hour of wakefulness (assuming the graph is created
without any artificial form of regulating sleep such as the alarm clock,
delaying sleep, etc.). Your own optimum hour is naturally likely to differ
(check with <i>SleepChart</i>). For most people the optimum hour falls into the range 16-20. If your graph looks like below and
you wake up at 6 am, you can conclude that you can best go to sleep shortly
before midnight (so that you could ensure you are in bed when the 18th hour of
wakefulness comes up). Some people take naps during the day. Others don't. The
graph below is typical of a regular napper with the optimum nap time coming at
7-8 hour of wakefulness. For example, if you get up at 6 and your optimum nap
time hits the 8th hour, you should take a break around 14 and look for a
secluded place for a few minutes of rest. Naturally, planning your lunch at
13:00 or so would be recommended too. In the graph below, 8.2% of sleep blocks
begin in the 18th hour (night sleep), while another 8.1% begin in the 8th hour
(nap). Non-nappers will also experience a peak of sleepiness around the 7th hour
even though their blue-line graph will not show as prominent a bulge as below.<br>
<b><br>
Circadian: </b>The red line corresponds with circadian sleepiness derived
from the average length of sleep blocks started at a given hour of the waking
day. The graph indicates that even if you are able to initiate sleep during the
day, it will never last long. Only after 14 hours of waking does the length of
initiated sleep reach beyond 6 hours. Maximum length of sleep can be achieved at
15th hour; however, this does not indicate this is the optimum hour of going to
sleep. If sleep is initiated too early, it may or may not make it possible to
catch on the full circadian low. In other words, we can wake up after just a
couple of minutes of sleep and make it harder to fall asleep again (due to
instantly losing the homeostatic sleepiness). In addition,
sleep initiated before the full circadian low does not seem to be of more value
that slightly shorter sleep initiated a bit later (e.g. as reflected by the
subjective feeling of being refreshed in the morning, or as measured
polysomnographically). The blue homeostatic line
indicates that the sleep is more likely initiated at 18th hour, while its
average length is 6.5 hours. If your graph is generated without attempts to
artificially regulate sleep, the second peak in the homeostatic curve may
indicate your optimum hour of retirement. The graph indicates that if you delay
your sleep by one hour, it will be shortened by 10-30 minutes. It is possible,
that even this little shortening will affect your performance during the day. If
you advance your sleep by one hour, it may be 10-30 minutes longer but its
quality is not likely to increase. In addition, you run the risk of premature
awakening (breaks in sleep are ignored in the graph as this makes it easier to
determine the circadian low).&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/sleep.gif" width="825" height="585"></p>

<p><b>Phase shift graph in DSPS</b></p>

<p>The phase shift graph may be used by people suffering from ASPS and DSPS.
This graphs helps you see at what time you are likely to fall asleep for a given
waking time. For example, in the graph below, you can see that if your waking
time comes at 7 am, your best retirement hour (blue line) comes at 1 am.
However, if you happen to wake up naturally at 11 am, you are not likely to be
ready for sleep before 5 am the next day. The lighter pink and gray lines
indicate the timing of a nap. Again, if you wake up at 7 am, your best napping
time might occur between 15:00 and 16:00. <b>Remember! </b>Each individual will
have a his or her own unique graph. Moreover, the graph will look differently if
it is taken at times of work or at times of summer vacation. It will be affected
by stresses at work and at home. It may even change when you move from one house
to another, or when you change the climate zone. The graph will slope only for
people with sleep phase problems and will accurately reflect your rhythm only if you
adhere to free-running sleep. If you use an alarm clock, this graph will be
meaningless!</p>
