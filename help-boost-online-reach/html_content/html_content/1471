<p>I love eggs. Scrambled, soft boiled, hard-boiled, fried, or an omelette, I've yet to find a way of serving an egg  that I didn't fundamentally think was wonderful.

<p>And yet I haven't eaten a poached egg in 15 years.

<p>Why? Fear. Fear of getting it wrong. Fear of "stringy egg soup". Fear of stinky vinegar stinking up the house.

<p>So I thought to myself, "surely there's a website that'll give me advice on the perfect poached egg?"

<p>And to google I go, and of course there is a thousand and one bloody sites. And guess what? It's a hotbed of  conflicting advice. Every chef has a different method. I'm confused, I don't want choice - I want results.

<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/google.gif" ><br>Hmmm. The only thing to do is to try out a few methods and see  which ones the best.</p>

<hr size="1">

<h2>Delia "Frying Pan" Smith </h2>

<p>Delia is an expert on eggs. She's produced TV shows and books solely dedicated to eggs, surely she'll have the 

best 

damn method known to man. And yet her unconventional approach suprises me. She wants me to pour the egg into a 

simmering frying pan of water! Lunacy, I tell you, lunacy.

<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/delia1.jpg"><br>Here's our simmering frying pan of water. I have a bad feeling 

about this.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/delia2.jpg"><br>In the egg goes. We have to leave the heat on for one minutes. 

This is looking like a strangely watery fried egg. Or a jelly fish.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/delia3.jpg"><br>Taking the pan off the heat and covering it with a lid, we leave the 

egg for 10 minutes in the now cooling water. 10 minutes? I'm getting bored. So I photograph my phone. 

<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/delia5.jpg"><br>The egg is now "cooked". It looks bloody revolting. The yolk is too 

hard, and the lack of white coating is extremely disappointing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/delia7.jpg"><br>There's also an upsetting amount of egg left in the pan.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Takes too long. Who has ten minutes to poach an egg? A recent TV campaign tells us eggs are "the original fast 

food". Well not according to Delia.
<li>Unappetising. A poached egg shouldn't look like a mucus covered fried-egg.
<li>Delia knows jack-shit about poaching eggs. 
<li>Overall: 3 out of 10
</ul>

<h2>Hugh "Vortex" Fearnley-Whittingstall</h2>

<p>Hugh's method for eggs is so short that I can quote it here: 

<blockquote>
"The perfect poached egg: break the egg into a cup, being careful not to break the yolk. Bring a small pan of water 

to  the boil. When it is boiling rapidly, stir fast with a large spoon to create a vortex. Pour the egg into the 

centre  of the vortex, place the lid on the pan and turn off the heat under it. Leave for exactly 2 minutes."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>It's the word <i>vortex</i> that gets me excited. It's the kind of thing that Doctor Who gets trapped in, and not 

the kind of word you normally find in cooking. I'm sure you could sell lots of cookbooks to geeks if only we had 

chapter titles like, "Omelettes and particle accelerators", "Tesla coils - fried eggs in nanoseconds", or even "Say 

no to whisks. Use the fork, Luke." </p>

<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/hugh1.jpg"><br>I attempt to create my vortex. Although it's looking 

disappointingly unvortexy. I'm not convinced I can create enough rotary motion with a wooden spoon. Nor can I hold a 

camera steady whilst stirring.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/hugh2.jpg"><br>And in the egg goes. It spins around like a demented octopus, 

creating more legs than one would normally want in an egg.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/hugh3.jpg"><br>Two minutes are up. Mr Poachy isn't looking promising. It's the 

dreaded egg soup.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/hugh4.jpg"><br><i>"Mummy. Please don't make me eat the seagull poo."</i></p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/hugh5.jpg"><br>Hugh, I am deeply upset.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although a lot quicker to cook than Delia's method, I wouldn't feed this to a dog.
<li>Excitingly-worded recipies aren't a short-cut to culinary success.
<li>Overall: 1 out of 10
</ul>

<h2>Elaine "Drop the Pot" Corn</h2>

<p>I have no idea who Elaine Corn is, but she's the Google number 1 return for "poached eggs", and if Google thinks 

she knows her eggs, then who am I to argue?

<p>Her method involved dropping a pot into boiling water, and <i>leaving the pot inside the pan.</i> Such decadence I 

have to try.</p>


<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/elaine1.jpg"><br>It's actually rather difficult to place the pot in the pan 

without burning your fingers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/elaine2.jpg"><br>Oh no! My pot is too light and it floats, preventing the egg from 

escaping. Possibly the method would work better if I weighed the pot down with some nice healthy lead.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/elaine3.jpg"><br>Success! Elaine pisses on the pretenders Delia and Hugh from a 

great height. And my egg has mandibles and looks like a crab. Result. </p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/elaine4.jpg"><br>Although a fair bit of egg sticks to the pot.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<li>Great egg. Soft yolk, with a complete firm white coverage.
<li>Burning fingers and pot floatiness is a problem, but could be resolved with asbestos gloves and a heavier pot.
<li>Overall: 8 out of 10

<h2>Vash "Clingfilm" Stampede</h2>


Blimey. Halfway through putting this page together, the oddest bit of synchronicity strikes: I recieve an email 

saying:

<blockquote>
From: VashTheStampede<br>
Subject: Top Tippery<br><br>

If you're going to poach an egg, and don't want to spend 20 mins cleaning the pan here's what to do:
<ul>
<li>Get some microwaveable clingfilm
<li>Get a cup
<li>Push the cling film into the cup, and crack the egg into the cling film
<li>You should be able to tie the clingfilm around the top of the egg,
<li>Drop egg into boiling water, and poach normally, it'll taste great, and you wont have to spend ages scrubbing 

cooked on egg of the damn pan.
</ul>
</blockquote>

Clearly the gods are smiling on me today, so let's get to work. 

<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/cling1.jpg"><br>Into the clingfilm he goes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/cling2.jpg"><br><i>"Look mummy. I've won an egg!"</i></p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/cling3.jpg"><br>Toss him in. It would be a great way to cook a goldfish.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/cling4.jpg"><br>Oooh. No mess at all.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/cling5.jpg"><br>I don't actually own the correct spoon for this. I'm using a 

pasta fork my dad gave me for Christmas.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/cling6.jpg"><br>Perfect! It's bloody perfect.</p>
<p><img src="/images/howtopoachanegg/cling7.jpg"><br>All eggs should be cooked like this from now on.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<li>The pictures speaks a thousand words.
<li>If you want a poached egg, clingflim is your friend.
<li>Overall: 10 out of 10
